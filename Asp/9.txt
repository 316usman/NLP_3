Primordial black holes (PBHs) remain a viable dark matter candidate in the asteroid-mass range. We point
out that in this scenario, the PBH abundance would be large enough for at least one object to cross through the
inner Solar System per decade. Since Solar System ephemerides are modeled and measured to extremely high
precision, such close encounters could produce detectable perturbations to orbital trajectories with characteristic
features. We evaluate this possibility with a suite of simple Solar System simulations, and we argue that the
abundance of asteroid-mass PBHs can plausibly be probed by existing and near-future data.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Our Universe contains a substantial amount of dark mat-
ter (DM), per decades-old consensus [1, 2]. Despite well-
motivated theoretical models for various particle DM candi-
dates spanning nearly fifty orders of magnitude in mass (see
e.g. Refs. [3–7]), there is as yet no direct evidence that DM
consists of a new elementary particle species. In recent years,
an alternative hypothesis has regained traction: that perhaps
much or all of the DM consists of primordial black holes
(PBHs) [8–10]. Numerous observables restrict the properties
of PBHs that could account for DM, but a window of about
six orders of magnitude in mass remains fully unconstrained.
For masses 1017 g ≲ MPBH ≲ 1023 g—that is, for masses
typical of asteroids—PBHs could account for the entire DM
abundance. (For recent reviews, see Refs. [11–15].)

The constraints at the boundaries of this region are well
established. The upper limit is set by constraints from ex-
tragalactic microlensing surveys [16, 17]. The lower limit
arises from efficient Hawking evaporation, since high-energy
cosmic rays emitted by light black holes would be read-

ily detectable [18–24].
ever, the asteroid-mass range has proven difficult to probe.
Originally, microlensing constraints were thought to apply
in this regime as well as at higher masses [25]. However,
Refs. [16, 17, 26] demonstrated that the effects of wave optics
and finite source sizes severely weaken lensing constraints be-
low 1023 g.1 Moreover, limits from stellar capture estimated
by Ref. [27] were later weakened by updated arguments in
Ref. [26]. As a result, PBH DM remains largely unconstrained
in the asteroid-mass regime, and the future of the PBH DM
hypothesis depends crucially on probes of this portion of the
parameter space.

In this paper, we consider a novel means to probe PBHs
in the asteroid-mass range. We focus on the effects of PBHs

on the motions of individual astronomical objects, similarly
to Refs. [28–30]. In particular, in order to achieve the high-
est possible sensitivity, we propose the use of the highest-
precision astronomical measurements available: Solar System
ephemerides. Given more than five decades of lunar laser-
ranging data [31–33], more than two decades of precision
monitoring of Mars orbiters [34, 35], and sophisticated track-
ing of the motions of thousands of smaller objects [36–40],
our own Solar System is richly instrumented for the detection
of massive interlopers. We therefore evaluate the observable
effects of low-mass PBH encounters on the revolutions of the
celestial spheres [41].

In particular, we study the prospects for detecting perturba-
tions to the measured distances between Earth and Solar Sys-
tem objects (SSOs) due to PBH flybys. If they account for all
of DM, the abundance and phase space distribution of PBHs
can be readily determined—and if MPBH lies in the asteroid-
mass range, then at least several flybys through the Solar Sys-
tem should be expected to have occurred over the lifetime of
modern observing programs. The expected rate of observ-
able events depends both on the PBH mass distribution and
on the precision with which the motions of various Solar Sys-
tem objects are presently monitored. As we demonstrate here,
if the entire DM abundance consists of PBHs with masses
1018 g ≲ MPBH ≲ 1023 g, then Solar System ephemerides
could plausibly detect PBH flybys at a rate of order once per
decade. This could either enable a quasi-direct detection of
PBHs or place new constraints in the asteroid-mass range.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we per-
form a simple order-of-magnitude estimate of the expected ef-
fects of a PBH transit on Solar System observables, demon-
strating a favorable detection rate for perturbations to the dis-
tances between Earth and Solar System objects from flybys
at an impact parameter of several au. In Section III, we im-
prove on our analytical estimate with simplified Solar Sys-
tem simulations, and we identify the expected properties of
observable signals, focusing on the distances between Earth
and various inner planets (Mercury, Venus, and Mars). We
justify this choice with a discussion of damping mechanisms
that might attenuate a signal of a PBH transit, and argue that
our minimalist simulations are representative of the qualita-
tive features of transits. In Section IV, we analyze ensembles

lar System ephemerides to transits with varying parameters.
Section V summarizes our proposal for a new means of prob-
ing asteroid-mass PBHs. We also discuss next steps, particu-
larly the incorporation of more sophisticated numerical meth-
ods that include additional physical effects. We highlight the
prospects for our proposed observable to test the hypothesis
that PBHs account for all of DM.

Throughout this paper, we work in natural units with c =

ℏ = kB = 1 unless otherwise noted.

II. ENCOUNTERS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

In this section, we introduce our proposed observable, and
perform a rough estimate of the size of the effect. This leads
us to a first estimate of the rate of detectable flyby events.
We then discuss the physical effects that complicate a proper
computation of the flyby signature, motivating the application
of numerical computations in the following section.

A. Detecting PBH flybys

If a PBH were to transit our Solar System, it would perturb
the motion of visible objects. State-of-the-art simulations of
the motions of objects within our Solar System include the
DE441 model maintained by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
[37] and the INPOP21a model maintained by the Observa-
toire de Paris [39]. (See also Refs. [42, 43].) The JPL DE441
model, for example, incorporates the Sun and eight planets,
nearly 300 planetary satellites, more than 1.3 million aster-
oids, and almost 4000 comets. Such simulations depend on
high-precision observations of various objects for benchmark-
ing. Among the most precise data used in these ephemerides
concern the Earth–Moon distance and the Earth–Mars dis-
tance. For the Earth–Moon distance, lunar laser ranging has
succeeded in achieving an accuracy of
(1 mm) over the past
fifteen years [31, 32], while precision monitoring of various
Mars orbiters and landers since the late 1990s yields an accu-
racy of

(10 cm) for the Earth–Mars distance [34, 35, 39].

O

Motivated by the extraordinary precision of these measure-
ments, we consider the Solar System as a single large com-
pact object detector. The calculation of the rate of observ-
able flybys is similar to the calculation of the event rate in
a DM direct detection experiment. For simplicity, we as-
sume a monochromatic mass distribution for PBHs at a mass
MPBH. Given the mass density ρPBH, the number density is
nPBH = ρPBH/MPBH. If PBHs account for all of DM, then
0.4 GeV/cm3 in the solar neighborhood [44–46].
ρPBH
In particular, within a sphere centered on the Sun with radius
equal to the orbit of Jupiter (5.2 au), one expects to find a
[MPBH/(1018 g)]−1
number of PBHs given by NPBH = 1.4
at any given time. Moreover, these objects should have a
Maxwellian distribution of velocities, with a typical speed
of v0
220 km/s [45, 46]. Thus, given a geometric cross
section σ, the rate of transits through this patch is given by
Γ =

nPBHσv0.

We now estimate the cross section σ for detectable PBH
flybys. As a first estimate of the effect on various Solar Sys-
tem objects from a PBH flyby, we consider a simplified pic-
ture involving only the Newtonian interaction of two point
masses: a PBH of mass MPBH and a visible Solar System
object of mass MSSO. Since v0 is much larger than typical or-
30 km/s and
bital speeds in the Solar System—e.g., vMoon
24 km/s—we may assume an instantaneous interac-
vMars
tion, in which the Solar System object remains at rest while
the PBH travels in a straight path along its initial direction
ˆv, with an impact parameter bPBH with respect to the object.
Then the instantaneous force perpendicular to ˆv exerted on the
Solar System object by the PBH flyby will have magnitude

Since the flyby occurs on a timescale that is very short com-
pared to the orbital period of the Solar System body, we can
ignore the effects of other forces on this timescale and com-
pute the imparted momentum from the instantaneous force
within the well-known impulse approximation. The instan-
taneous momentum imparted to the Solar System object is
dp⊥ = F⊥ dt = F⊥ dx/v0. The net impulse velocity
δv = p⊥/MSSO imparted to the Solar System object by the
PBH flyby can then be estimated by integrating this differen-
tial impulse over the entire trajectory, yielding

We now use Eq. (2) to estimate the rate of detectable per-
turbations at the order-of-magnitude level. Suppose that the
object is monitored for a time ∆t following the perturba-
tion. Over this time, the difference induced in the mea-
sured distance from Earth, r, can be crudely estimated by
∆t. The actual value of δr is dependent on all of
δr = δv
the parameters of the encounter. However, the value δv
∆t
can be plausibly attained if the encounter accelerates the ob-
ject along its direction of motion, modifying its orbital period.
Over time, the orbit accumulates a slight phase difference with
respect to the original trajectory, corresponding to a difference
in the distance with respect to Earth.

This shift, δr, is the difference between the distance r that
would be measured with a PBH flyby versus without, as a
function of time. In the context of a Solar System model, δr
would be the residual introduced between the model and data
when the system is perturbed by a PBH flyby. We will refer to
δr as the “residual” or “perturbation” for the remainder of this
work. Note that r always denotes the distance between Earth
and a given Solar System object. We use x to denote the posi-
tion of an object in barycentric coordinates, so the distance of
an object from the Sun is denoted by x =

For a first estimate of the detection rate, we take a flyby
to be detectable if δr exceeds the uncertainty σr of the mea-
∆t ≳ σr. Saturating the in-
sured distances, i.e., if δv

which is 3.3 au for the benchmark values in Eq. (4). This sug-
gests that current and near-future ephemerides are capable of
probing PBH DM at masses that are otherwise unconstrained,
with sensitivity driven mainly by flybys at distances typical of
inner planet orbits. This enormous effective detector area is
what enables the “direct detection” of such massive DM par-
ticles.

Even as crude approximations, these results are only viable
in a fairly narrow mass range. At low masses, the result of
Eq. (4) is cut off when bmax becomes comparable to the ra-
dius of the object in question. For Mars, this occurs at a very
1012 g, but such a detection would require
low mass MPBH
104 yr.
an implausibly long observing time of order ∆tmin
Moreover, such perturbations will be damped by other physi-
cal effects on timescales that are long compared to the orbital
period of the target object. We anticipate that perturbations
could be detectable for PBH masses as low as 1018 g, but no
lower—indeed, our observable breaks down entirely at low
masses, since the high number density of PBHs would lead
to a high rate of encounters, introducing interference between
different flyby signatures and ultimately washing out the sig-
nal of interest. At very high PBH masses, when bmax
r,
Earth itself receives a comparable impulse, and δr is sup-
pressed. For this reason, we do not expect to constrain PBH
masses above 1023 g. Conveniently, 1023 g is also the upper
bound of the unconstrained mass range for PBH DM.

Note that ∆tmin has no dependence on the parameters of
the target object itself, but only the precision with which the
distance between the target and Earth is measured. Naively,
this suggests that the Earth–Moon system would be the ideal
detector: since the Earth–Moon distance is measured with a
1 mm, one might hope to detect objects
precision of σr
with MPBH
10 yr.
This would fully cover the open window for PBH DM. How-
ever, as we will discuss in the next subsection, damping ef-

fects are more significant in the Earth–Moon system, and the
methods we use here are not well suited to estimate δr in this
case. Instead, we will focus on the distances between Earth
and the other inner planets, which guides our estimates in the
following sections.

B. Damping of orbital perturbations

We emphasize that the estimate in the previous subsec-
tion assumes not only that observational measurements of dis-
tances can be performed with precision σr, but also that sim-
ulations can reproduce these distances with comparable accu-
racy, so that the residual δr can be meaningfully computed.
This is no small feat: such simulations are extremely complex
and computationally expensive. In this work, we develop only
a proof of principle, and we make no effort to reproduce the
sophisticated simulation frameworks developed over several
decades in the Solar System dynamics community. Instead,
we seek a case in which the many physical effects in these
simulations should make a small fractional contribution to the
residual δr induced by a PBH flyby, regardless of their impact
on the distance r itself.

More precisely, we estimate δr in a perturbative framework,
separating the response of the system into an initial perturba-
tion, δr0, and higher-order terms δrn describing the backre-
action of the system on the modeled perturbation due to the
unmodeled effects. Formally, we write

∞

δr = δr0 +

δrn[δrn−1],

(6)

n=1
(cid:88)
where we note that δrn depends on the functional form of
δrn−1(t) as a function of time. We assume that in the pres-
ence of the perturbation δr0, each unmodeled effect makes
an instantaneous contribution δr′′
1 (t) to δr′′(t), which can
be integrated over the observing period to give δr1(t) =
t
1 (t2). The perturbation δr1 itself sources a
0 dt1
correction δr2, and so on. We seek a case where the higher-

n=1 δrn is small compared to δr0. This
framework is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows schematically
how δr0 can be interpreted as an approximation to δr.

t1
0 dt2 δr′′
(cid:82)

(cid:80)

The interpretation of the higher-order terms is best illus-
trated by an example. A PBH flyby occurs, and we compute
the residual in our simple model: this is the modeled initial
perturbation δr0. However, our model does not include the
acceleration due to solar radiation pressure, which is slightly
modified in the presence of the perturbation δr0. The differ-
ence in radiation pressure gives rise to a difference in the ac-
celeration of the object in question, which is integrated to give
a correction δrrad
. This correction again modifies the acceler-
ation due to radiation pressure, which gives rise to a correction
δrrad
2
Our computation of δr0 from modeled effects is a reli-
able approximation to δr only under conditions in which the
higher-order terms δrn>0 can be shown to be small in com-
parison to the initial perturbation. In what follows, we demon-

strate that for the inner planets,

Notice that when δr0 = 0, all of the terms δrn>0 also van-
ish, which might lead one to think that the higher-order terms
δrn>0 scale with δr0/r. This need not be the case, because
these terms may instead scale with other dimensionless ratios
δr0/ℓi. There are many other length scales ℓi—for example,
the distances to other bodies, the radius of the object, the scale
of inhomogeneities within the object, and the gravitational pa-
rameters GMi of various bodies. These other length scales
can be much smaller than r, so that δr0/ℓi can be large even
when δr0/r is small.

Using this perturbative language, we now identify specific
unmodeled contributions and assess their significance for our
computations. The simple estimates of the previous section
neglect several physical effects that must be included when
simulating the motion of visible objects within our Solar Sys-
tem to the accuracy attained by reference-quality models. In
this section, we study the size of the ratio
for each
of the effects which are considered in the detailed numerical
simulations of Refs. [36, 38] but which are not included in our
simple model, and we identify cases where the corrections are
subdominant over the relevant observational time-scale.

We consider four categories of corrections, in roughly de-

scending order of importance for Solar System flybys:

1. Inclusion of additional bodies. State-of-the-art compu-
tational models of Solar System ephemerides include
many Solar System objects beyond the Sun and planets.
(We address this point in Section III.)

2. Newtonian finite-size effects. Since Solar System ob-
jects are not point masses, there are tidal forces between
extended bodies, which allow energy loss to heating
and deformation. The nonvanishing surface area of ex-
tended bodies leads to an additional force from solar
radiation pressure.

3. Relativistic point-mass effects. Post-Newtonian point-
mass corrections to the gravitational interactions among
N bodies, proportional to both (v/c)2 and to the New-
tonian potential GM/r, modify the acceleration of each
object.

4. Relativistic finite-size effects. Finally, in the context of
extended bodies, post-Newtonian corrections including
the Lense–Thirring effect contribute to spin–orbit cou-
pling in particular.

Each of these effects contributes to δr1 and higher terms in
Eq. (6).

It is tempting to think of a PBH flyby of an orbiting body
in the Solar System as a perturbation to an equilibrium system
in the same way that we think of perturbations to a classical
harmonic oscillator. However, such a simple picture is inac-
curate. Indeed, over very long time-scales, the orbits of So-
lar System bodies are far from stable [47–49]. Furthermore,

FIG. 1. A schematic illustration summarizing the notation and
premise of Section II B. In this work, we approximate δr with a sim-
plified model, which is not sufficient for accurate predictions of real
ephemeris data. Still, under certain conditions, we can use our sim-
plified model to compute the differences in distance produced by a
PBH flyby at time t0. The bottom panel shows distances from Earth
to a given Solar System object (SSO) as might be produced by the
simple model (yellow curve). The simple model closely fits mock
data (yellow crosses) before the PBH flyby, but is always a poor fit
to actual ephemerides (blue crosses). Fitting these is possible only
with a sophisticated, reference-quality model (blue curve). Nonethe-
less, we seek a case in which the residuals between data and model
induced by the PBH flyby (gray bars) are comparable in the simple
model and the reference-quality model. The top panel shows both
sets of residuals, with the difference between them (shaded region)
accounted for by terms δrn>0 in Eq. (6). We argue in Sections II
and III that for some Solar System objects, the higher-order contribu-
tion is small compared to the residuals, as illustrated in the top panel.
This is precisely why we need not attain the amazing precision of
models like DE441 or INPOP21a in order to estimate sensitivity to
PBH flybys.

this approach misses the key difference that while energy-
dissipating effects, such as friction, tend to damp the perturba-
tions to a classical harmonic oscillator, the opposite can some-
times be true for dissipative effects in complex Solar System
orbits over long time-scales (i.e. many orbital periods) [50].
Moreover, dissipative effects in the Solar System are driven
by finite-size effects that are suppressed by the small sizes of
objects in comparison with their distances. Nondissipative ef-
fects can also correct δr, particularly many-body effects that
can transfer energy from the body in question and redistribute
it amongst other Solar System bodies. But ultimately, to good
approximation, bodies in the Solar System conserve their me-
chanical energy on time-scales of order their orbital periods

bodies in the system, there is no mechanism to quickly restore
the system’s prior configuration.

That said, the observable that we consider here is an ex-
tremely small effect, so even a very small amount of differen-
tial dissipation or energy exchange could erase the signature
of a PBH transit. Thus, in the remainder of this section, we
briefly estimate the significance of each of effects 2–4 above.
Effect 1 is treated in Section III.

Newtonian finite-size effects. Finite-size effects are fa-
mously nonnegligible between planets and their moons. In-
deed, for the Earth–Moon system, these effects are significant:
given that REarth = 6357 km and the average Earth–Moon
105 km, the suppression of
distance is rEarth–Moon = 3.84
10−2. On
tidal effects is only of order REarth/rEarth–Moon
the other hand, finite-size effects are much more strongly sup-
pressed for the Earth–Mars system, with REarth/rEarth–Mars

10−5. Therefore, for the remainder of this paper, we focus on
quantities such as the Earth–Mars distance rather than on the
Earth–Moon system. Treating such well-separated objects as
point masses is consistent with the treatment in the reference-
quality models DE441 [37] and INPOP21a [39, 40]. For sim-
ilar reasons, we neglect spin-orbit coupling, which remains
thoroughly subdominant for the systems and scales of interest
here. Fully controlling corrections from tidal dissipation in the
Earth–Moon system requires more sophisticated simulations,
and is beyond the scope of this work.

The effects of solar radiation pressure, on the other hand,
are easy to approximate. The incident radiation power is

Clearly, then, the Lense–Thirring contribution to δr1 is negli-
gible for the inner planets on the timescale of interest.

The above discussion accounts for all effects of interest ex-
cept for item 1 in our original list: the inclusion of other Solar
System objects. This is intractable analytically, so in the next
section, we turn to simulations to study the correction δrNB
due to a complex N -body Solar System.

III. SOLAR SYSTEM SIMULATIONS

A. Features of flybys

We simulate PBH flybys using the REBOUND code [55],
taking the masses and initial conditions of Solar System ob-
jects (SSOs) from the JPL Horizons database [56]. Our sim-
ulations include all of the planets and a selection of smaller
objects. To simplify integration, we combine planets and their
moons into single particles. The full list of objects is given
in Table I. We perform the simulations using the WHFast in-
tegrator [57]. For high-precision simulations, the IAS15 inte-
grator [58] is usually more appropriate, despite higher com-
putational complexity. We directly compared the behavior of
WHFast to IAS15, and found that WHFast is sufficient for the
cases considered in this work.

As discussed in Section II B, our simulations are much sim-
pler than the state-of-the-art simulations used to construct So-
lar System ephemerides. Relativistic corrections, radiation
pressure, and extended-body effects are not included. Ad-
ditionally, the list of objects is far from exhaustive. Beyond
moons, high-quality simulations include at least hundreds of
individual asteroids, and additionally include the averaged ef-
fects of many smaller asteroids [36–40].

The population of Solar System asteriods is of particular
relevance. After all, one might expect that asteroids would
have effects on the same order as PBHs in the “asteroid-mass”
range, which could pose a challenge to the goal of using Solar
System dynamics to identify PBHs at these masses. However,
the unconstrained window for PBH DM actually extends to
masses that are quite high for asteroids. There are very few

and those asteroids are well tracked [59]. Moreover, even as-
teroids at lower masses have manifestly different kinematics:
most noticeably, their influence on the ephemerides of other
Solar System objects is periodic, as opposed to the single im-
pulse delivered by a PBH. Thus, we expect that the effects of
a PBH at the upper end of the “asteroid-mass” range can be
differentiated from the effects of asteroids.

When adding a PBH to the simulation, we give the PBH
a fixed initial speed of 200 km/s, reflecting the typical DM
velocity in the Milky Way halo. We specify the flyby with
six parameters: one for the mass, three for the initial position,
and two for the direction of the initial velocity. The initial
position rPBH
is specified with respect to the Solar System
barycenter in spherical coordinates rPBH
, Π0, and ϕ0. The
initial distance rPBH

We begin with a benchmark simulation taking MPBH =
1021 g, rPBH
= 450 au, Π0 = ϕ0 = 0, α = 2/450, and
β = π. These parameters are chosen so that the impact pa-
rameter with the barycenter (and therefore the perihelion) is
approximately 2 au. We show a point in time from this simu-
lation in Fig. 2. The estimates in the preceding sections sug-
gest that an impulse from a PBH flyby should be detectable in
Solar System ephemerides. However, in the context of the real
Solar System, two critical questions must still be addressed:

1. Is a measurable impulse generated at all, given realistic

orbital trajectories?

2. How do complicated N -body dynamics affect the evo-

lution of the initial perturbation?

In this section, we answer these questions using N -body sim-
ulations. We configure simulations with and without a per-
turbing PBH and directly estimate δr (that is, compute δr0)
by comparing these simulations.

B. Simulation configuration

We run our simulations for a total of 20 years, and we sam-
ple the positions of objects in our simulations with a realistic
observational cadence of 20 days (40 days for Mars). At each
sample time, we record the distance rSSO(t) between Earth
and each tracked object. We also perform a simulation with
no added PBH, obtaining timeseries rbase
SSO(t). For each SSO,
we then obtain

The value of δr0 in this simulation is shown as a function
of time for each of the inner planets in the left panel of Fig. 3.
The simple estimate of the impulse model in Eq. (2) is shown
by the dashed lines. A few qualitative features are immedi-
ately clear from the figure:

1. The flyby is rapid: the vertical gray band shows the ex-
tent of the time period during which the PBH is within
10 au of any of the Solar System objects for which δr is
shown. The PBH flyby indeed represents a momentary
impulse.

2. For this combination of parameters, δrMars

exceeds
σr = 0.1 m within
(1 yr) and grows to 1 m within
ten years of PBH perihelion, even though Mars has the
largest distance to the PBH among the objects tracked.

0

3. The impulse model predicts the size of δr at the order-
of-magnitude level, but noticeably fails at the
(1)
level. In particular, the sizes of the impulse predictions
follow the opposite order from those of the simulated
δr values. The difference is especially pronounced for
Mercury.

FIG. 3. Left: δr between Earth and Mercury (purple), between Earth and Venus (green), and between Earth and Mars (orange) for the same
encounter shown in Fig. 2. For each object, the distance of closest approach of the PBH is given in parentheses. We set t = 0 at the PBH
perihelion. (Note that the PBH follows a hyperbolic trajectory, so perihelion occurs only once.) The vertical gray band indicates times at which
t. Right:
the PBH lies within 10 au of any of the objects shown here. Dashed lines show the simple prediction of Eq. (2), i.e., δr = δv

[r]. The power peaks sharply at these frequencies, as expected for a slight modification
to the orbital parameters.

4. Each perturbation is oscillatory, and indeed nearly
monochromatic. The envelope grows almost linearly
with time.

We now comment briefly on the implications of each of these
features.

The fact that the flyby is rapid justifies the use of the im-
pulse approximation in Eq. (2), explaining why this remark-
ably simple computation succeeds at predicting the rough be-
havior of δr. It also establishes a clear distinction between
the kinematics of a PBH flyby and what might be expected
of a close encounter between two Solar System objects: the
PBH flyby is nearly instantaneous on the dynamical timescale
of the Solar System. Any successful fit of a PBH transit
model to data will sharply identify the time at which the transit
took place, whereas Solar System objects interact over longer
timescales.

Moreover, one of the objects tracked in this fairly generic
simulation exhibits a computed δr larger than any of the esti-
mates from the impulse approximation. This serves as the first
numerical evidence for the plausibility of our overall premise:
that detection of PBHs is possible with current and future data
on realistic observational timescales.

However, despite the order-of-magnitude success of
Eq. (2), the fact that this computation fails to predict the rela-
tive magnitudes of the impulses delivered to each of the Solar
System objects signifies the importance of the phases of the
planets in their orbits and the precise location and direction
of the PBH flyby. In particular, this means that Eq. (2) is not
well suited to predict event rates, and we should expect the
rates of Eq. (4) to be substantially modified in the context of
simulations. This also means that even an order-of-magnitude
estimate of the overall rate requires an ensemble of simula-

tions in order to properly marginalize over arrival directions
and times.

r

Finally, we observe that the actual perturbation δr is not
only oscillatory, but is dominated by a particular frequency:
the peak frequency of the variation in the unperturbed Earth–
SSO distance r(t). Motivated by the nearly-monochromatic
oscillations in the left panel of Fig. 3, we show in the right
panel the power spectral density of δr for the 100 years fol-
lowing the PBH perihelion. The dashed vertical lines mark
the frequencies f SSO
at which the power spectral density of
the unperturbed r(t) attains its maximum for each tracked
object—essentially, the inverse period of the main component
of the distance from Earth to each object. This is to be ex-
pected for small changes to the orbital parameters, since the
perturbation to the distance will then oscillate on the timescale
of the orbital period. The spectrum of δr also contains de-
creasing peaks at the integer harmonics nf SSO
for each ob-
ject. This characteristic profile in frequency space is of great
utility, since it enables the use of template-matching tech-
niques to identify PBH flyby events in noisy data. We discuss
this possibility further in the coming sections.

r

At this point, we have performed a simple estimate of δr
using the impulse approximation in Eq. (2); we have argued
that all of the neglected physical effects are unimportant to the
computation of δr, apart from the presence of other bodies;
and we have performed N -body simulations to demonstrate
that the signal in δr remains viable in a realistic Solar Sys-
tem, and indeed has several valuable properties. Our first set
of simulations also suggests that such parameters as arrival di-
rection and the phases of planetary orbits cannot be neglected.
Since PBHs would arrive from random directions and at ran-
dom times, the effects of these parameters should be included
into our estimates via an ensemble of simulations. We take up

IV. PROSPECTS FOR DETECTING PBH DARK MATTER

We now combine the results of the previous sections to ob-
tain appropriate figures of merit for potential constraints on
PBH dark matter. We frame the expected detection rate Γ in
language similar to DM direct detection experiments. The de-
tection rate for fixed PBH parameters Π is simply the flux Φ
of objects multiplied by the probability p of detection. That
is, we have

Γ =

dnΠ

(cid:90)

dΦ
dΠ ×

p(Π).

(16)

The flux of objects is n¯σv0, where n is the number den-
sity, v0 is the typical velocity, and ¯σ is the cross section of
the “detector”—in our case, an arbitrary large volume en-
compassing the inner Solar System. (The larger the volume,
the lower the average probability of detection.) We choose
this volume to be a sphere of radius rtarget
50 au cen-
tered at the Solar System barycenter, so that ¯σ = π(50 au)2,
and we fix v0 = 200 km/s. Then the differential rate is
dΓ/dΠ = ¯σv0 (dn/dΠ) p(Π).

≡

We estimate Γ by taking a simple representative form for
the probability of detection: we say that a PBH flyby is de-
tected if the peak value of δr exceeds some threshold value
in ratio to the width of the noise in the measurement of r.
Specifically, we define qfom as the maximum value of the sum
in quadrature of qSSO
over all objects. That
is,

δrSSO/σSSO

≡

r

(17)

This is a figure of merit for the size of the perturbation in-
duced by the flyby with a form motivated by statistical con-
siderations, and we set p(Π) = Θ(qfom
q0) for some fixed
q0, where Θ is the Heaviside step function. With this def-
inition, p(Π) is an indicator function on the PBH flyby pa-
rameter space that is 1 for detectable flybys and 0 otherwise.
We can then perform the integral in Eq. (16) directly by sam-
pling flybys with impact parameter bPBH < 50 au, i.e., flybys
whose trajectories pass through the target region with cross
section ¯σ.

−

Detailed analysis of the range of realistic values for q0 is
beyond the scope of the present work. Obviously, the value
of q0 = 1, corresponding to max δr = σr, corresponds to a
large effect, and surely should be counted as detectable. How-
ever, given the properties of the perturbation in our numerical
results, much smaller values of q0 are plausibly accessible.
The perturbation δr is very long-lived, with a regular and pre-
dictable form in Fourier space, which suggests that filtration
techniques from signal processing can substantially enhance
the sensitivity to small signals. As a reference point, we con-
sider the methods used in the analysis of LIGO data, which
routinely enables extraction of signals with an amplitude of

tude is shown at a fixed time, 10 years after PBH perihelion, in ratio

with the encounters shown in Figs. 2 and 3. For sufficiently small
perturber mass, the size of the perturbation is linear in the mass, as
anticipated from Eq. (2). For an encounter with these parameters,
PBH masses below 1031 g are in the linear regime.

order 10−4 relative to noise [60]. This level of refinement
is prior to any analysis of correlations between detectors, an
analogue of which is also possible in our case by use of corre-
lations between perturbations to different Solar System ob-
jects. Hence, for the remainder of this work, we consider
10−2 < q0 < 10−4 as a benchmark range.

0

We numerically approximate the integral of Eq. (16) by
sampling values of Π. We work at fixed mass and speed,
so only five parameters remain: rPBH
, θ0, ϕ0, α, and β, per
the parametrization of Section III. We sample uniformly in ϕ0
and cos θ0, reflecting a random arrival direction. (We neglect
the DM “wind” associated with the motion of the Solar Sys-
tem in the galactic frame.) We sample rPBH
uniformly on
[300 au, 700 au], so that all starting points are far from the
Solar System, and with perihelion times in a uniform range
with a width of 400 au/(200 km/s)
9.5 yr. We sample
β uniformly on [0, 2π]. We sample α uniformly subject to
the restriction that the impact parameter should fall within the
cross section of the target, i.e., bPBH = r0 tan α
rtarget.
We draw 218 = 2.6
105 samples from this parameter space
using the Sobol sequence method.

Naively, one might expect to evaluate this integral anew
for each PBH mass of interest. We simplify our computa-
tion by observing that Eq. (3) predicts that δr is linear in
MPBH. Equation (3) is only a simple estimate, but this feature
motivates us to check linearity within our numerical simula-
tions: while linearity should not hold for general MPBH, it
should be restored for sufficiently small MPBH. We thus di-
rectly compute δr for Mars ten years after the PBH perihelion
in our benchmark configuration for a range of different PBH
masses, with the results shown in Fig. 4. We find that δr is
indeed linear in the PBH mass as long as MPBH ≲ 1031 g.

fixed mass density. The mass Mdet is marked with a dot for
each curve in Fig. 5. As the mass is lowered below Mdet, the
survival function drops below 1, and the detectable event rate
is limited by the detection sensitivity. The rate peaks at

Under the assumptions above, Fig. 5 demonstrates the po-
tential for nontrivial constraints on PBH DM in the range
1018 g < MPBH < 1023 g with the use of
(30 yr) of
ephemeris data. Above 1023 g, the rate is suppressed by the
very small number density of PBHs in the neighborhood of
our Solar System. Below 1018 g, despite the high rate shown
in Fig. 5, the flux becomes so large that there are many en-
counters over the observing period, and our estimates are no
longer valid. Backgrounds also become much more signifi-
cant in this regime, as there are numerous Solar System ob-
jects with masses of this order, and not all of them are well
tracked.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Primordial black holes (PBHs) remain a compelling can-
didate for dark matter (DM). To date, a combination of ob-
servational and theoretical constraints leaves open a window
1017 g ≲ MPBH ≲ 1023 g within which PBHs could ac-
count for the entire DM abundance [11–15]. Probing this mass
range—either to yield a quasi-direct detection of a DM can-
didate or to further constrain PBHs as DM—has proven dif-
ficult. In this paper, we describe a new observable for PBHs
as DM, which leverages decades of precision tracking of the
motions of objects within the inner Solar System. In partic-
ular, we demonstrate that the inner Solar System itself could
function as a compact-object detector, by exploiting state-of-
the-art observing programs and Solar System ephemerides.

In this paper we have identified robust observables from
transient flybys of PBHs within several au of the Solar Sys-
tem barycenter; estimated the likely effects on the motion of
closely tracked Solar System objects from such flybys; and
simulated an ensemble of such flybys with which to estimate
a realistic detection rate. Given these simulations, much of
the presently allowed mass range 1017 g ≲ MPBH ≲ 1023 g
could be successfully probed using the types of data and Solar
System simulations that are already available.

Our present N -body simulations have neglected subdom-
inant effects on objects’ motions—such as Newtonian finite-
size effects, relativistic point-mass corrections, and relativistic
finite-size effects—and our simulations include only a subset
of the huge number of Solar System objects that are included
in leading ephemerides programs such as the DE441 model
maintained by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory [36, 37] and the

the linear regime, so we can always obtain δr at any mass of
interest from a simulation at a single mass by simply rescal-
ing the result. We choose to perform all simulations with
MPBH = M base

1027 g.

The numerical sampling produces a full distribution of qfom
at MPBH = M base
PBH. Given that qfom can also be rescaled lin-
early with the PBH mass, we can readily study the behavior of
the detection rate as a function of mass. We fit a power law to
the tail of the distribution of qfom, truncating at the most ex-
treme values (qmin
fom ) obtained in our simulations. This
simple form for the distribution of qfom, combined with the
simple form for p(Π), leads to a simple and interpretable mass
dependence. The survival function of qfom takes the form

This estimate is shown for several values of q0 in Fig. 5,
assuming ρPBH = ρDM. The features of Γ(MPBH) are read-
ily understood. At masses above a critical value Mdet =
(q0/qmin
PBH, the probability of detection is very high, i.e.,
the survival function in Eq. (19) is 1. In this regime, the detec-
tion rate is simply the flyby rate, which scales with the PBH

[38–40]. Nonetheless, by quantifying the relative contribu-
tions to Solar System dynamics from the types of objects and
dynamics that our simulations neglect, we have argued that
our proposed observable provides a viable and realistic possi-
bility for probing the stubborn, remaining mass range within
which PBHs could account for all of DM.

To move beyond the estimates analyzed in this paper, sev-
eral steps will be necessary. First, because the expected
signals δr from transient PBH flybys are comparable to the
present errors σr with which the distances between Earth and
various Solar System objects are tracked, it will be imperative
to use more precise Solar System simulations and decades of
high-precision observational data.

Second, upon using more accurate models of Solar Sys-
tem dynamics, one may exploit the quasi-periodic nature of
the expected signal from a PBH flyby, as shown in Fig. 3, to
develop a bank of time-series templates with which observa-
tional data may be filtered, akin to standard procedures for
projects like LIGO [60]. In addition, observable signals could
be extracted from real-world noisy data by focusing on cor-
relations among the (perturbed) motions of several Solar Sys-
tem objects, such as Mars and Venus, rather than focusing on
single objects alone.

By using decades of high-precision tracking data from
various Solar System observing programs, combined with
expertise already at hand within the Solar System dynam-
ics community, the intriguing possibility that DM consists

neighborhood—adding a novel search strategy to the decades
of direct-detection efforts that have been devoted to finding a
well-motivated DM candidate.

Note added: As we were completing this work, Ref. [61]
appeared, which likewise proposes a means of detecting
(or constraining) PBHs within the asteroid-mass range using
decades of high-precision tracking data, in their case from net-
works of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) in Earth
orbit. The PBH masses to which each method is most sensi-
