ABSTRACT　 Oxidative  stress  is  considered  the  principal  mediator  of  myocardial  injury  under  pathological  conditions.  It  is
well known that reactive oxygen (ROS) or nitrogen species (RNS) are involved in myocardial injury and repair at the same time
and that cellular damage is generally due to an unbalance between generation and elimination of the free radicals due to an inad-
equate mechanism of antioxidant defense or to an increase in ROS and RNS. Major adverse cardiovascular events are often asso-
ciated with drugs with associated findings such as fibrosis or inflammation of the myocardium. Despite efforts in the preclinical
phase of the development of drugs, cardiotoxicity still remains a great concern. Cardiac toxicity due to second-generation anti-
psychotics  (clozapine,  olanzapine,  quetiapine)  has  been  observed  in  preclinical  studies  and  described  in  patients  affected  with
mental disorders. A role of oxidative stress has been hypothesized but more evidence is needed to confirm a causal relationship.
A better knowledge of cardiotoxicity mechanisms should address in the future to establish the right dose and length of treatment
without impacting the physical health of the patients.

Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics

are used in the treatment of mental dis-
orders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
major depressive disorder). Since marketed, cloza-
pine was widely used because of its efficacy in drug-
resistant schizophrenia and freedom from extrapyr-
amidal effects. After clozapine, other antipsychotics
were introduced (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone)
with similar effects and the same safer profile and
soon became the mainstay of the treatment of
schizophrenia.[1] The therapeutic effect of second-
generation antipsychotic agents is related to dopa-
minergic D2 receptor antagonism and to the block-
age of serotonin receptors. Major cardiovascular ad-
verse effects (tachycardia, bradycardia, hyperten-
sion, hypotension, syncopal episodes) and electro-
cardiographic abnormalities (prolonged QT interval)
are reported in patients suffering from mental dis-
orders and treated with antipsychotics.[2–8] An in-

creased risk of sudden death has been also reported
but the risk of underreporting is concrete because of
the lack of a systematic post-mortem examination.[9–13]
In addition, individuals with schizophrenia are
known to be at greater risk of cardiac death, in part
linked to inadequate lifestyles that predispose to
cardiovascular disease, in part due to poor compli-
ance with health care.[14–16] However, many typical
and atypical antipsychotic drugs have been reported
in the literature to significantly increase the risk of
sudden cardiac death in patients with psychiatric
disorders,[17] and this has led to restrictions in clinical
practice or the withdrawal of these molecules from
the market. A retrospective cohort study showed
that the incidence of sudden cardiac death in sub-
jects taking antipsychotics is increased (dose-related
increase) compared to non-users of antipsychotics,
regardless of the pharmacological class.[18]

Sudden antipsychotic cardiac death appears to be

linked to arrhythmic mechanisms, dilated heart dis-
ease, and myocarditis.[19–21] In the pathogenesis of
the aforementioned cardiological alterations, an in-
volvement of oxidative stress has been suggested,
with an increase in reactive oxygen (ROS).[22] ROS
modulates multiple cellular signaling pathways in
physiological conditions. However, when the pro-
duction of intracellular ROS is excessive it causes
damage to the molecular components of the cell, fa-
voring the pathogenesis of various diseases with
particular reference to cardiovascular ones.

Despite the large use, factors underlying cardi-
ovascular disease in patients treated with anti-
psychotics are still far to be completely understood
and need to be deeply studied.[23–27] Growing in-
terest is aimed at understanding the contribution of
antipsychotic therapy in the genesis of cardiac tox-
icity in schizophrenic patients.

The purpose of the present study is to review the
scientific literature on the topic and propose a pos-
sible explanation of antipsychotics-related cardi-
otoxicity.

LITERATURE ANALYSIS

Relevant scientific articles were identified from
PubMed, Cochrane Central, Scopus, Web of Science,
Science Direct, EMBASE up to January 2020 using
the following keywords: “atypical antipsychotics”,

“cardiomyopathy”, “myocarditis”, “oxidative
stress”, and “sudden cardiac death”. The main
keywords were individually searched in associ-
ation with each of the others.

The resulting 527 references were screened to ex-
clude duplicates, which left 67 articles for further
consideration. In addition, non-English papers were
excluded and the following inclusion criteria were
used: original research articles, reviews and mini-
reviews, documents and guidelines promulgated by
scientific societies and international organizations,
and book chapters.

The papers not suitable for the review were ex-
cluded, a hand search was performed through the
reference lists of the included articles. These public-
ations were carefully evaluated considering the
main aims of the review. An excel data extraction
form was used to extract pivotal data, including
publication year, first author, types of scientific art-
icles, the topic of the study. This evaluation left 106
scientific papers, distributed as original research
articles, reviews, and mini-reviews (Figure 1). These
reports were published between 1981 and 2020.

The features of included papers were described in
Tables 1–3. The table was organized by dividing the
main topics of the present review into three sub-
groups: the relationship between heart disease and
use of antipsychotic drugs, the relationship between

Oxidative Stress and Cardiac Injury

Superoxide anion (O2-), hydroxyl radical (OH-),
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), singlet oxygen, carbon-
centered radicals, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), nitric oxide
(NO), and nitrogen dioxide radicals are the free
radicals identified in the human heart. Under basal
conditions, the production of free radicals is low.
However, the maintenance of intracellular redox
homeostasis is fundamental to guarantee the phy-
siological cardiac functions (development and mat-
uration of cardiomyocytes, the release of intracellular
calcium, and the coupling of cardiac excitation/
contraction).[28] The physiological intracellular levels
of ROS are maintained by an antioxidant defense
system which includes superoxide dismutases,
catalase, the glutathione peroxidase/reductase sys-
tem, and the peroxiredoxin/thioredoxin system.
When pathological conditions occur (e.g., myocar-

dial ischemia), hyperproduction of O2- is observed
from multiple cellular sources, the cellular antiox-
idant defense system is depleted and the free radicals
scavenging enzyme system superoxide dismutase,
glutathione peroxidase, chloramphenicol acetyl-
transferase is significantly reduced.[29] ROS can
cause severe oxidative damage, especially to DNA,
lipids, and proteins. Lipids are the class of biological
molecules most susceptible to attack by oxygen
free radicals. Oxidation takes place on the fatty
acids present in cell membranes or lipoproteins,
producing toxic substances for cells and tissues.
Furthermore, as far as proteins are concerned, these,
following the oxidation of the –SH groups of some
amino acids (His, Arg, Lys, Pro) and the liberation
of iron by the degradation of the porphyrin rings by
ROS, lose their physiological structure and there-
fore functionality. In DNA, the oxidative phenomena
concern the purine and pyrimidine bases;[30] one of
the most studied markers of DNA damage from
oxidative damage is represented by 8-OHdG.[31] The
excessive production of ROS determines the activa-
tion of cell death, with consequent apoptosis or
myocardial necrosis.[32] In the pathogenesis of cardiac

pathologies, a fundamental role is played by
mitochondrial-derived ROS, which derives from
electron transfer into the mitochondrial respiratory
chain complexes and from the action of mitochon-
drial proteins. Mitochondria are one of the main
drivers of intracellular oxidant production and other
relevant sources are nicotinamide adenine dinuc-
leotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOX family
of enzymes). Besides, other enzymes contribute to
intracellular ROS production, including xanthine
oxidase, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), cyclooxy-
genases, cytochrome P450 enzymes, and lipoxy-
genases.

Several data in the literature suggest that this
type of ROS is involved in the pathogenesis of nu-
merous cardiac pathologies, such as myocardial in-
farction, heart failure, and diabetic cardiomyopathy.[28]
Specifically, in cardiac infarction, hypoxia induces a
decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with con-
sequent loss of depolarization of the mitochondrial
membrane with activation of anaerobic glycolysis,
lactate formation, and cytosolic calcium accumulation.[33]
These cellular damages are finally further imple-
mented by the reperfusion of hypoxic cells, causing
an increase in cellular necrosis. Otherwise, in heart
failure, the cellular modifications related to ROS occur
in a more dilated time span. The basis of these
modifications is the interaction between the in-
crease in angiotensin II and the increase in myocar-
dial stress, with consequent cardiac remodeling,
contractile dysfunction, and the onset of arrhythmias.[34]
The role played by NADPH oxidase (NOX) seems
to be relevant in the failure, which can uncouple the
NO synthase and promote O2-.[35] Also, angiotensin

II-mediated ROS increase activates nuclear factor
kappaB induced hypertrophy pathway.[32]

Instead, diabetic heart disease is linked to the ac-
cumulation of fatty acids in cardiomyocytes with a
consequent reduction in the use of carbohydrates as
an energy substrate especially during periods of
high demand for ATP and, consequently, increased
formation of ROS with mitochondrial damage and
promotion of apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. The per-
oxisome proliferator-activated receptor, a nuclear
hormone receptor which modulates the metabolism
of glucose and fatty acids, is involved in this heart
disease.[36]

Finally, oxidative stress, in association with the
increase in inflammation products, promotes en-
dothelial dysfunction through the inactivation of
NO, an important molecule with a vasodilator and
anti-atherogenic role. NO inactivation is promoted
by NADPH oxidase and uncoupled NOS.[37]

In light of these data, there is growing interest in
the literature about the role played by ROS in the
pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases and the
possible experimental use of antioxidant molecules
in the treatment of heart diseases.

Cardiovascular Complications from Antipsychotics

Atypical antipsychotic therapy is notoriously as-
sociated with cardiovascular pathologies and an in-
crease in sudden cardiac death.

Second-generation antipsychotic drugs have a
significant influence on the development of meta-
bolic syndrome, which is known to be a risk factor
for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, a correla-
tion is known with myocarditis,[8] dilated heart dis-

ease,[10] and QT tract prolongation, which repres-
ents an important risk factor for the development of
malignant arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.[38]
In addition to this, subjects affected by schizo-
phrenia, regardless of the therapy taken, have addi-
tional cardiovascular risk factors on a dysmetabolic
basis, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, reduced
glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and obesity.[5]

As for the adverse effects of the dysmetabolic
type, as previously mentioned, atypical antipsy-
chotics can cause weight gain, especially olanzapine
and clozapine, and related metabolic disorders such
as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dys-
lipidemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis.[16]

It is also known that obese and diabetic subjects
have an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation,
ventricular ectopia, and long QT.[39] Besides, dia-
betes mellitus and obesity are associated with an in-
creased risk of sudden cardiac death, which is often
caused by ventricular arrhythmias. As regards the
electrocardiographic changes induced by antipsy-
chotics, it has been observed that the use of these
drugs is associated with prolongation of the QTc,
that is, prolonged cardiac repolarization.[40] QTc is
defined on the electrocardiogram as the period
between the onset of the Q wave (ventricular depol-
arization) and the cessation of the T wave (ventricular
repolarization) corrected for heart rate. It is known
to be an indicator of potential proarrhythmic tox-
icity as it can lead to a specific polymorphic ventri-
cular arrhythmia known as torsade de pointes
which can develop into malignant arrhythmias such
as ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.
The most common mechanism of antipsychotic me-
diated QTc prolongation appears to be blockage of
the hERG channel in the myocardium which pre-
vents outward movement of potassium responsible
for ventricular depolarization.[41] The risk increases
in the presence of underlying heart diseases associ-
ated with abnormal repolarization, electrolyte ab-
normalities, and co-treatment with other drugs (di-
uretics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers).[42] For
this reason, treatment with antipsychotics should
only be undertaken if there is a concrete therapeutic
advantage and some authors propose the applica-
tion of stratification measures for patients at greater
risk of developing this condition before starting
therapy.

Among antipsychotics, there was an increased
risk of QTc prolongation for typical antipsychotics;
in particular droperidol and thioridazine are associ-
ated with an increase in QTc in a dose-dependent
manner.[43] However, there are data in the literature
that also describe it for atypical antipsychotics. Clinical
studies have reported a clear association of the
aforementioned electrocardiographic alteration and
sertindole and risperidone, in a dose-dependent
manner,[42] although among the atypical antipsy-
chotics, ziprasidone is the riskiest,[44] so much so
that it has been proposed to take an electrocardio-
gram at the start of therapy.[45]

Preclinical studies have reported a dose-dependent
prolongation of the QT interval with other atypical
antipsychotics as well, namely clozapine and olan-
zapine.[42] Finally, antipsychotic therapy, although
rarely, can be associated with severe complications
such as myocarditis and evolving cardiomyopathies
towards decompensation. This is especially true of
clozapine,[45] an atypical antipsychotic used for res-
istant schizophrenia and prevention of suicide risk.[46]
In addition to myocarditis, cases of cardiomyopathy
have been described, albeit more rarely.[47] This is
also more frequent with clozapine with a later onset
than myocarditis (the average onset was reported in
a study after 12 months) and associated with high
mortality.[48] Specifically, clozapine, in therapeutic
doses, can also be associated with the occurrence of
serious cardiovascular side effects, very rare but de-
scribed in the literature as dilated cardiomyopathy,
pericarditis and concomitant myopericarditis asso-
ciated with parenchymal lung disease.[49] Finally,
complete atrioventricular blockage by ingestion of
massive drug doses of clozapine has been described,[50]
which can be fatal if not promptly recognized and
managed.

For this reason, the United States Food and Drug
Administration has included potentially fatal events
and cautious use of clozapine in patients with pre-
existing cardiac diseases and with severe cardiac
conditions among the adverse effects of clozapine.[11]
A retrospective study of all adverse drug reactions
reported voluntarily to the Australian Adverse
Drug, identified an incidence of suspected myocar-
ditis ranging between 0.7% and 1.2% of patients
treated with clozapine, with an average age of 30

years; the disease developed on average two weeks
after starting therapy with a mortality rate of 10.3%.[51]
Myocarditis is an uncommon, dose-independent,
potentially lethal adverse effect; probably underes-
timated due to the often, atypical clinical manifesta-
tion and the poor compliance of these patients with
medical treatment. In fact, the clinical presentation
can be very variable, ranging from subclinical forms
to fulminant heart failure.

Sudden death after clozapine intoxication due to
eosinophilic myocarditis was first described in
1992,[52] but the same was also reported in sub-
sequent several clinical cases with the use of thera-
peutic doses of the drug.[53]

Although with extremely rare incidence, cardi-
omyopathy has also been described with quetiapine,
an atypical antipsychotic structurally similar to
clozapine, suggesting a pharmacological class
effect.[54] According to the WHO’s program for in-
ternational drug monitoring, myocarditis and cardi-
omyopathy induced by the use of quetiapine are
typically present mimicking myocardial infarction
with acute ST-segment elevation on electrocardio-
gram. As well as for clozapine, the mechanism of
quetiapine-induced cardiotoxicity is still undefined.
The use of antipsychotics is burdened by an in-
creased risk of sudden cardiac death; in fact, in sub-
jects taking antipsychotics, the risk of sudden cardiac
death has more than doubled in consideration also
of weight gain, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes
mellitus related to antipsychotic treatment.[15] To these
risk factors, additional environmental cardiovascular
risk factors are added, such as smoking, alcohol
abuse, poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle, and stress,
which are often present in individuals suffering
from schizophrenia.

Sudden cardiac death in patients taking anti-
psychotics has a multifactorial nature, resulting
from a complex interaction between the aforemen-
tioned environmental factors, any pre-existing car-
diac substrates, both structural and genetic, and the
pathological action of these drugs at the cardiac
level. However, the underlying molecular mechan-
isms are still to be understood also concerning the
causal weight of a possible heritable component
that can make individuals taking antipsychotics
more susceptible to sudden cardiac death.

OXIDATIVE STRESS IN ANTIPSYCHOTIC-
RELATED CARDIOMYOPATHIES

Marketed drugs have been often associated with
cardiovascular major adverse events and safety con-
cerns due to a significantly increased risk of cardiac
fibrosis, myocardial infarction, and myocardial in-
flammation. Despite efforts in the preclinical phase
of the development of drugs, cardiotoxicity remains
a great concern due to the lack of sufficient know-
ledge of the mechanism of cardiotoxicity. Linkage
with the entity of intracellular ROS and RNS reac-
tion has been evocated to explain drug-induced
myocardial injury.[55] Oxidative and nitrative modi-
fications of key mitochondrial proteins have a central
role in drug-induced cardiotoxicity.[56] The oxid-
ative stress resulting from increased free radical
generation in cardiomyocytes produces an energetic
imbalance, impairment of mitochondrial function,
activation of stress-related signaling pathways, p53
accumulation, and cellular loss.[57] By the way, it has
been supposed that administration of antioxidants
(vitamin C and vitamin E, carvedilol, L-carnitine,
N-acetylcysteine, coenzyme Q10, dexrazoxane) is
associated with a decrease in ROS-induced cardi-
omyocytes damage and can play a role in reducing
drug-induced cardiotoxicity.[58,59]

An analysis of the literature highlights the need
to acquire more data on the pathogenesis of heart
disease induced by atypical antipsychotics through
post-mortem studies. Conversely, numerous pre-
clinical studies on animal models have been carried
out to understand the pathogenesis of heart disease
associated with individual antipsychotics. To clarify
the role played by oxidative stress in the origin of
pathologies affecting the heart induced by atypical
antipsychotic drugs, it appears useful to analyze the
cardiac pictures related to them individually (Figure 2).

Myocarditis

Myocarditis is mainly described in patients tak-
ing clozapine, although it has also been reported in
association with the use of other second-generation
antipsychotics.

Clear evidence about dose-related clozapine car-
diotoxicity is still far to be demonstrated. The mech-
anism by which clozapine induces cardiotoxicity re-

Figure 2    Antipsychotic drugs appear to be linked to arrhythmic mechanisms, dilated heart disease, and myocarditis. In the path-
ogenesis  of  the  aforementioned  cardiological  alterations,  an  involvement  of  oxidative  stress  has  been  suggested,  with  an  increase  in

proposed. An immunoglobulin E-mediated hyper-
sensitivity (type I allergy) has been proposed for the
first time by Killian, et al.[60] as a mechanism of car-
diac toxicity in clozapine-treated patients. The res-
ults of necropsy showed mainly lymphocytic and
mixed infiltrates with myocytolysis, consistent with
an acute pharmacological reaction.[61] Then, eosino-
philic myocarditis was described in the sudden
death of patients treated with clozapine, and a hy-
pereosinophilic action of clozapine was proposed as
the main mechanism of cardiotoxicity.[13,20,62,63] Fi-
nally, a role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, cat-
echolamines, and oxidative stress was proposed.[64–66]
Bioactivation of clozapine in the myocardial tissues
is associated with the generation of a chemically re-
active nitronium ion metabolite which stimulates
cellular injury, lipid peroxidation, and formation of
free radical. When bound with a protein of the
myocardium, this nitronium ion produces an anti-
genic complex that stimulates an immune response,
and activates macrophages releasing proinflamma-
tory cytokines.[67,68]

To support the importance of oxidative stress in
clozapine-associated myocarditis, there is a study
conducted by Abdel-Wahab, et al.[69] This study
aimed to study the protective effect of captopril
against clozapine-induced myocarditis in rats and
the possible mechanisms underlying this effect. Ad-

ministration of the angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitor reduced the histological signs and bio-
chemical markers (creatine phosphokinase–MP
isoenzyme and lactate dehydrogenase) of myocarditis,
as well as reduced the oxidative stress parameters
(NO and DNA degradation products) in a dose-
dependent manner, suggesting how the cardio-
interpretive effect exerted by captopril, in the pres-
ence of clozapine-induced myocarditis, is also me-
diated by the reduction of oxidative stress.

A clinical study reported that the erythrocyte
concentration of selenium, an antioxidant molecule,
was reduced in schizophrenic patients taking cloza-
pine compared to those who did not take it and
compared to patients with mood disorders and
healthy controls. This evidence suggests that re-
duced antioxidant activity may contribute to the de-
velopment of cardiological complications related to
clozapine, including myocarditis.[70]

High levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)
in association with an increase in catecholamines
have also been described in antipsychotic-related
myocarditis and dose dependence has been demon-
strated. TNF-α hyperproduction is related to the at-
traction of leukocytes and the generation of further
free radicals and cytotoxic proteins.[71–76] High levels
of myeloperoxidase were observed in experimental
studies with clozapine-treated animals and were in-

dicated as a sensitive marker of neutrophil migra-
tion and myocardial injury.[74] Histopathological ex-
amination of the heart of mice treated with cloza-
pine showed a significant dose-related increase in
myocardial inflammation. The latter correlated with
plasma catecholamine and TNF-α levels. Further-
more, this effect was significantly reduced in mice
treated with propranolol, compared to controls,
suggesting a potential immune-mediated mecha-
nism of action of clozapine.[64]

A preclinical study was conducted to investigate
the influence of clozapine, ziprasidone, and sertin-
dole on rat heart morphology and determine whether
redox status plays a role in the development of car-
diac histopathological changes induced by anti-
psychotic.[67] The results showed that all three drugs
induced cardiac histopathological changes related
to a picture of toxic myocarditis. In particular,
clozapine increased the activity of superoxide dis-
mutase 1 while ziprasidone reduced the activity of
glutathione reductase. Sertindole did not exert any
marked effect on the function of antioxidant en-
zymes in the heart even though myocardial degen-
eration was observed. In conclusion, treatment with
clozapine or ziprasidone induced pathophysiolo-
gical changes in the rat heart, which seemed to be
associated with disturbances in antioxidant capa-
city. Finally, an antioxidant molecule (edaravone) is
effective in reducing myocardial damage in animal
models of acute autoimmune myocarditis in associ-
ation with a reduced state of oxidative stress.[77]

Cardiomyopathy and Cardiac Injury

Heart disease is another adverse effect associated
with antipsychotics, although the pathophysiolo-
gical mechanisms underlying the processes of
myocardial remodeling in association with a pro-
arrhythmic condition with increased risk of sudden
death are not clear in this context too.

A preclinical study supports the importance of
mitochondrial oxidative stress in the presence of
heart disease characterized by an increase in an-
giotensin II levels, proposing the use of mitochon-
drial antioxidants in the prevention of evolving ar-
rhythmias towards sudden cardiac death in the
presence of the renin-angiotensin axis.[78] An in-
creasing amount of data in the literature indicate
that cardiac mitochondria are involved in the genesis

of arrhythmia. In fact, the energetic state of the
mitochondrial network can alter the potassium
flows through the ATP-sensitive potassium chan-
nels (essential for cell survival in the face of oxid-
ative stress), creating the electrical conditions to
favor fatal arrhythmias. For this reason, the cardiac
mitochondrial network has emerged as a key target
for strategies that seek to reduce arrhythmias through
the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity in the
face of metabolic stress, preserving the integrity of
the membrane potential.

Preclinical data also clearly show that edaravone,
a new free radical scavenger, improves the evolu-
tion of dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac remod-
eling by modulating oxidative stress.[79]

Cardiomyopathy related to taking atypical anti-
psychotics can, at least in part, be due to cardi-
omyocyte apoptosis, known to be important in the
pathogenesis of patients with severe heart failure
from various etiologies.[80] Experimental studies on
mice proposed a programmed cell necrotic death
(necroptosis) as a possible explanation for the cardi-
otoxicity of quetiapine. Myocytes treated with
quetiapine showed disruption of the cellular mem-
brane, mitochondria swelling with reticulum ex-
pansion and generation of oxygen reactive species.
These effects are reversed by the administration of
necrostatin-1, a TNF inhibitor,[27,81] suggesting a
close correlation between inflammation, oxidative
stress, and cell death.

Treatment with clozapine has been also associ-
ated with an increased cardiac level of total nitrite, a
stable end product, an indirect marker of NO. In-
creased formation of NO produced by inducible
NOS has a negative inotropic effect and contributes
to the progression of myocardial damage poten-
tially leading to cardiac fibrosis.[82–91] Besides, hyper-
expression of peroxynitrite in cardiac samples was
observed at an immunohistochemical study which
was involved in direct oxidative damage to lipids,
proteins, cardiac cells, and myocytes and in the ni-
tration of tyrosine residues of pro-apoptotic pro-
teins in cardiomyocytes.[92,93] In fact, increased NO
formation is associated with lipid peroxidation, in-
activation of enzymes, and depletion of reduced
glutathione and it confirmed that antipsychotic car-
diotoxicity is related to increased oxidative stress
and weakened antioxidant defense.[94,95]

Metabolic Syndrome

The use of atypical antipsychotics is associated
with the development of the metabolic syndrome. It
has been proposed that the metabolic alterations in-
duced by these molecules and the increase in ar-
rhythmic risk related to lipid accumulation in cardi-
omyocytes involve oxidative stress.[96] Cardiac lipid
accumulation gives rise to non-ischemic cardiomy-
opathy called lipotoxic cardiomyopathy.

A preclinical study used a transgenic mouse
model of cardiac lipid overload with cardiac over-
expression specific to the peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor gamma, a paradigm of metabolic
syndrome in humans.[97] Lipotoxic cardiomyocytes
have been shown to exhibit increased ROS produc-
tion and impaired calcium homeostasis with in-
creased ventricular ectopy. This arrhythmic effect is
improved by the inhibition of mitochondrial ROS
through the use of a mitochondrial antioxidant mo-
lecule suggesting a potential role of mitochondrial
antioxidants in the prevention of arrhythmia and
sudden cardiac death in obesity and diabetes mel-
litus.

The role of metabolic stress concerning oxidative
stress in the development of these cardiomyopa-
thies is also highlighted in the preclinical study con-
ducted by Gong, et al.[98] Here it was shown that the
knockout mice of BAX transmembrane inhibitor
motif-containing 1, a suppressor of BAX-mediated
cell death and associated with the regulation of
ROS, present promotion of metabolic disorders and
cardiac dysfunctions induced by the diet rich in fats
with increased proinflammatory cytokines and ox-
idative damage.

In the light of these data, a clear relationship
seems to emerge between metabolic/inflammatory
alterations and oxidative stress, key elements for
the development of structural and arrhythmogenic
heart diseases that can lead to fulminant fatal events.

Sudden Cardiac Death

As for sudden cardiac death linked to antipsy-
chotics, this is probably caused by an arrhythmic
mechanism, but other mechanisms may be involved,
including autonomic effects, inhibition of other ion
channels or other acute cardiotoxicities, such as
myocarditis associated with the use of clozapine.

In the literature, numerous data are supporting
the involvement of oxidative stress in pathological
conditions involved in the genesis of sudden cardiac
death.

Ventricular arrhythmia is the main cause of su-
dden cardiac death. A relationship between metabolic
disorder and excessive oxidative stress has been
proposed with cardiac ion channel dysfunction,
which predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and
sudden cardiac death.

ROS production has been hypothesized to play a
significant role in arrhythmic substrate production.[99]
In particular, an abnormal mitochondrial function
can lead to an altered function or expression of the
cardiac ion channels responsible for the generation
of the cardiac action potential with the possibility of
generating re-entry phenomena implicated in the
development of malignant arrhythmias.

It is also known that an altered redox state is im-
plicated in cardiovascular pathologies such as athero-
sclerosis, diabetes mellitus and myocardial ischemia,
all conditions that can create a structural substrate
for increasing sudden cardiac death.[100] In particular,
in myocardial ischemia and heart failure, the effi-
ciency of the mitochondrial electron transport chain
is compromised with a consequent increase in ROS
production.[101] The aforementioned pathological
conditions are notoriously arrhythmogenic and pre-
dispose to sudden cardiac death and this could be
linked to an altered intracellular electrical and ionic
hemostasis consequent to the increase in ROS pro-
duction.

To support the importance of oxidative stress in
the genesis of heart disease associated with sudden
cardiac death, some data are emerging from pre-
clinical studies. Doxorubicin (molecule that increases
oxidative stress) injection knockout mice for the neuronal
nitric oxide synthase-1 adaptive (NOS1AP) protein
compared to wild types showed significantly higher
mortality, QTc prolongation, and reduced contra-
ctile function, as well as the development of spontan-
eous ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The administra-
tion of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine signific-
antly reduced the mortality of knockout NOS1AP
mice and prevented the prolongation of the QT in-
terval and the reduction of systolic function, sug-
gesting a fundamental role of oxidative stress in the

development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and
heart failure, which can cause sudden cardiac death.[102]

POST-MORTEM STUDIES

Several post-mortem studies have been carried
out on subjects who used antipsychotics in life to
highlight a correlation between the increase in mor-
tality from cardiovascular causes observed on
schizophrenics and the use of antipsychotics, typical
and atypical (Table 4).

As can be seen in Table 4, epidemiological/obser-
vational studies and a cohort study have been car-
ried out to assess cardiovascular risk in subjects
taking antipsychotics with a descriptive methodo-
logy.[8,18,103–107] In fact, databases were analyzed from
hospitals, mainly psychiatric, or from national re-
gisters, where the causes of death (cardiac and non-
cardiac) were reported in the appropriate death cer-
tificates.

However, in the literature, there are few system-
atic necropsy studies aimed at analyzing this aspect.
The post-mortem investigation described by Kelly,
et al.[104] analyzed a sample of sixty-two deceased
subjects treated at life with atypical antipsychotics
(clozapine and risperidone), highlighting that 11%
of the patients treated with clozapine and 7% of
those treated with risperidone had died of cardi-
ovascular causes. Also, three cases of cardiomy-
opathy were described in the group of subjects taking
clozapine and two cases in those taking risperidone.
Besides, three cases of myocarditis have been de-
scribed only in subjects taking clozapine.[104] A post-
mortem diagnosis of myocarditis has also been de-
scribed by Vang, et al.[8] This study included two
case reports relating to the death of two young men,
both who took olanzapine at therapeutic doses,
who died suddenly. In both cases, an autopsy, his-
tological and toxicological tests were carried out,
which made it possible to make diagnoses of death
of eosinophilic myocarditis. Another epidemiolo-
gical study carried out using a database on autopsy
data of all deaths occurring over a 26-year period
(1984–2009) in adults receiving care in one large
psychiatric hospital in New York, revealed the pres-
ence of twenty-two deaths from cardiovascular dis-
ease on one hundred cases of sudden death. The
twenty-two deaths from cardiovascular death were

divided as follows: fifteen deaths due to acute
coronary syndrome, two deaths due to heart failure,
two deaths due to aortic dissection, two deaths due
to myocarditis, and one death due to commotio
cordis.[103] Also, Ifteni,  et al.[106] used a register of
autopsy data from Maryland hospital databases
from 1989 to 2013. This study included a cohort of
7,198 schizophrenic patients hospitalized in psychi-
atric facilities. Of these, fifty-seven patients died of
sudden death during hospitalization and fifty-one
patients underwent autopsy. On autopsy, 62.8% of
deaths were attributed to cardiovascular causes,
such as myocardial infarction (52.9%), myocarditis
(5.9%), and dilated cardiomyopathy.

However, it should be noted that no studies have
analyzed the correlation between antipsychotic-
induced cardiac death and oxidative stress in hu-
mans. In this regard, numerous preclinical studies
previously exposed have highlighted the link
between cardiac damage induced by oxidative
stress/inflammation and antipsychotics. Concern-
ing this, numerous molecules have been analyzed at
the murine level; the alterations highlighted in the
various studies conducted included an increase in
TNF-α, an increase in catecholaminergic tone, an in-
crease in the ROS and nitrate pathways, the pres-
ence of DNA degradation products, and lipid per-
oxidation, as well as alteration of endogenous anti-
oxidant systems.

Specifically, animal models of myocarditis associ-
ated with the use of clozapine have shown an in-
crease in TNF-α and free radicals, effects that were
reduced with the use of propranolol, suggesting
that the increase in catecholaminergic tone could
mediate the inflammatory increase and oxidative
stress in this pathology.[64] The scarcity of post-
mortem studies suggests the need for research in
this sense, to be able to highlight whether oxidative
stress can at least partially mediate cardiotoxicity
due to antipsychotics also in human subjects. In this
sense, the increase in TNF-α can be assessed in hu-
mans through immunohistochemistry investiga-
tions on cardiac histological sections previously
treated with anti-TNF-α.[57] Furthermore, an index
of cardiac damage from oxidative stress is repres-
ented by the increase in the levels of malondialde-
hyde, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, and the re-
duced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio, both

of which can be assessed in humans through bio-
chemical analyzes, respectively of chromatographic
and spectrophotometric type.[108,109]

In addition to this, to highlight the presence of a
correlation between oxidative stress and heart dis-
ease induced by antipsychotics, it would be useful
to carry out immunohistochemical investigations
aimed at assessing the presence of oxidative stress
markers, such as inducible NOS, 8-OHdG, NOX2,
and finally the pathways of apoptotic death by
TUNEL assay.[57]

CONCLUSIONS

Cardiotoxicity of atypical antipsychotics repres-
ents a major concern in clinical practice due to its
large use in mental disorders. Major cardiovascular
adverse events and sudden unexpected deaths are
reported, but the mechanism of myocardial injury is
not completely known. An increase in myocardial
oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines may
play an important role in cellular death and DNA
damage. Post-mortem examination is still crucial for
research and must be seen as an opportunity for
early detection of patients at risk for an unexpected
death, and discovery of preventive measures.[110,111]
Post-mortem studies carried out show increased
cardiac death in subjects taking antipsychotics com-
pared to the general population, reporting cases of
myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and sudden cardiac
death. However, the pathogenesis of cardiac tox-
icity induced by these molecules is still unclear. A
potential role of oxidative stress in cardiotoxicity
caused by antipsychotics has been proposed in nu-
merous preclinical studies, but post-mortem data
from subjects taking atypical antipsychotics during
life is extremely lacking. It would be desirable to
carry out biochemical and immunohistochemical in-
vestigations on cardiac tissue of subjects who died
of cardiac death related to antipsychotics, to verify
whether oxidative stress can at least partially med-
iate the cardiotoxicity associated with the use of
these molecules. If the mechanism of cardiac tox-
icity of antipsychotics is clarified in the future clini-
cians will be able to better establish the dose and
length of treatment improving mental disease without
impacting the physical health of the patients redu-
cing mortality.[112–114]
