ABSTRACT

We present results from the search for astrometric accelerations of stars in ω Centauri using 13 years
of regularly-scheduled Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS calibration observations in the cluster
core. The high-precision astrometry of ∼160 000 sources was searched for significant deviations from
linear proper motion. This led to the discovery of four cluster members and one foreground field star
with compelling acceleration patterns. We interpret them as the result of the gravitational pull by an
invisible companion and determined preliminary Keplerian orbit parameters, including the companion’s
mass. For the cluster members our analysis suggests periods ranging from 8.8 to 19+ years and dark
companions in the mass range of ∼0.7 to ∼1.4M⊙. At least one companion could exceed the upper
mass-boundary of white dwarfs and can be classified as a neutron-star candidate.

1. INTRODUCTION

Since the beginning of measuring proper motions it is
implied that individual stars move along straight lines.
This is still a good approximation for most sources even
now in the Gaia era. If the motion indicates curvilin-
ear pattern, that would change the proper motion by
astrometric acceleration, usually measured in mas yr−2.
Stronger accelerations may allow to invoke the Keple-
rian formalism (e.g. Jia et al. 2019). Thus, the detec-
tion of astrometric accelerations near the radio source
Sagittarius A∗ was instrumental to eliminate all other
alternatives to the supermassive black hole (Ghez et al.
2000; GRAVITY Collaboration et al. 2018). This dis-
covery and additional astrometric accelerating sources

in the same area are examples of ground-based astrom-
etry of binary motion where one component is dark.

In 1990-1993 the Hipparcos space astrometry mission
regularly observed multiple times ∼118,000 pre-selected
stars. For the first time in history regular astrometric
observations were obtained outside the Earth’s atmo-
sphere and covering the entire celestial sphere. This ef-
fort resulted in 2622 acceleration candidates (Lindegren
et al. 1997) but none with a genuine invisible companion.
The third data release (DR3) of the Gaia space as-
trometry mission used data acquired between July 2014
and May 2017 and reported 338,215 acceleration solu-
tions and 165,500 orbital solutions (Halbwachs et al.
2023). A few illustrative cases of compact and invisi-
ble companions are presented by the Gaia consortium
in Gaia Collaboration et al. (2023a). To ‘weigh‘ an in-
visible companion one must determine the mass of the
primary source and it is desirable to obtain epoch radial
velocities. This recipe made it possible to discover Gaia
BH1 and Gaia BH2, two dormant black holes (BH) in

intermediate-period binaries (El-Badry et al. 2023a,b).
An opportunity to enhance the accuracy of proper mo-
tions and to probe very long-period accelerations is the
combination of the Hipparcos and Gaia catalogs (e.g.
Brandt 2021).

Although the Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) is not
an astrometric observatory, it has provided spectacular
science results such as the detection of the very small
tangential velocity of the Andromeda galaxy at 17.0 km
s−1 (van der Marel et al. 2012), establishing the up-
per limit of a putative, intermediate-mass black hole in
ω Cen (van der Marel & Anderson 2010), precision par-
allaxes (±45 µas) for long-period Cepheids in the Milky
Way with the spatial scanning technique (Riess et al.
2018), and the detection of astrometric microlensing by
a black hole (Sahu et al. 2022).

These breakthroughs gave us confidence that measure-
ments of astrometric accelerations are feasible with the
prime HST WFC3/UVIS camera. One configuration
that can generate a measurable acceleration in a few
years is a double star with a faint or dark secondary com-
ponent. In order to maximize the number of surveyed
sources and therefore the odds of detection, we focused
on dense stellar system such as the core of globular clus-
ters. Thanks to the foresight of the HST WFC3 team,
a multi-cycle calibration program targeting the center
of ω Cen (NGC 5139) was set in motion in 2010. So
far, a total of ∼200 well time-spread frames have been
accumulated, spanning over a total of 13 years. In cer-
tain aspects these observations may surpass the available
Gaia catalogues due to the 2-dimensional pointed ob-
servations, the longer time span, and the slightly better
spatial resolution which is critical in very crowded stel-
lar environments such as the cores of globular clusters.
However, the Gaia limitations due to source blending
and onboard resources discussed in (Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2016, Sect. 6.6) were partially mitigated by a spe-
cial observing mode (e.g. Sahlmann et al. 2016) and a
focused product release in the ω Cen region was pub-
lished on 10 October 2023 (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2023b), see Sect. 6.3.

A similar HST program (GO-12911, PI L.R. Bedin)
targeted the nearest (∼1.7 kpc) Galactic globular clus-
ter M 4 (NGC 6121 Bedin et al. 2013). However, the
timespan of these observations is only one year with an
expectation that this would be sufficient to detect the
astrometric ‘wobble‘. As of this writing, no accelerating
source in M 4 has been reported. The combined analy-
sis of proper motions from HST and Gaia DR3 claim a
central dark mass of 800 M⊙ in M 4 (Vitral et al. 2023).

2. HST /WFC3 OBSERVATIONS OF ω CEN

The observations of ω Cen were taken with the fourth-
generation imaging camera WFC3/UVIS on-board HST
installed during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009, with
the angular field of view of 2.′73 × 2.′73. The first ob-
servation in calibration program CAL-12094 (PI J. Kim
Quijano) was taken on 2009-07-15 to monitor the flat-
field uniformity through the filter F606W at the adopted
center of ω Cen (RA=201.◦69283 Dec=−47.◦47905).
The following calibration programs CAL-11911 (PI
E. Sabbi), CAL-12094 (PI L. Petro), CAL-12339 (PI
E. Sabbi) and the successive calibration programs 12353,
12714, 13100, 13570, 14031, 14393, 15000, 15593, 15733,
16413, 16588 (all by PI V. Kozhurina-Platais) are ad-
dressing a variety of specific aspects of the WFC3 in-
strumental calibration, such as photometric stability,
geometric distortions, and their stability (for the lat-
ter aspect, see also Sahlmann et al. 2019). All of these
programs used F606W besides some other filters and rel-
atively short exposure times of 35-40 or 60 sec and a va-
riety of roll angles from −170◦ to 180◦. During the first
five years nearly 50% of frames had a large 40′′ dither.
From the view-point of precision astrometry such dithers
could be detrimental due to the partial overlap. The
large variety of roll-angles produced a lower number of
total detections outside the radius of r=80′′ from the
adopted center. At larger radius and certain roll angles
some targets cannot be observed. This is visible in Fig-
ure 1. Altogether, for this study we selected a total of
175 images spanning 13 years with the last observation
on 2022-01-11.

The distribution of epochs over each calendar year is
not even. There are two intervals without observations:
April 29 to June 3 (35 days) and September 6 to De-
cember 12 (97 days). These ‘holes‘ are due to the un-
schedulability of ω Cen at those times. Some of the
other missing observations are due to failure of guide-
star acquisition.
In some cases, such periodic pattern
may spawn spurious one-year signals in the periodogram
analysis (Section 6).

3. DATA REDUCTION

The chosen flc- type images from the HST Mikul-
ski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) are a stan-
dard output of the HST calibration pipeline CALWFC3
with bias and dark subtraction, and flat-fielded on orig-
inal pixels. The flc.fits images are corrected for the
charge-transfer efficiency (CTE) in the HST pipeline
(Anderson et al. 2021). The effect of CTE tend to in-
crease with time and can affect the point-spread func-
tion (PSF). This can have an impact on the measure-
ments of stellar centroids and flux. Therefore, the pixel-
based corrections is a crucial step towards deriving high-

3

The output of hst1pass provides a geometrically-
correct gnomonic projection for a tiny part of the celes-
tial sphere. We used Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3)
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021) to provide the reference
frame. Preliminary tests showed that EDR3 source qual-
ity is atypical in the center part of ω Cen. If we limit
the EDR3 sources to the ones with positional error less
than 1 mas, then nearly 50% of them are missing proper
motion and there is a cut-off at G ∼18 mag. Clearly,
this is a consequence of the crowding and limitations of
Gaia onboard resources (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016;
Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2023).

Similar to Bellini et al. (2017) we selected the seed-
frame ibc301qrq flc taken on 2010-01-14. If we trans-
late the Gaia celestial coordinates to the epoch 2010.12
and then convert into gnomonic coordinates and align
them to the measured pixel coordinates of the seed
frame, the rms of the resulting residuals is ∼4.4 mas.
There are 440 common stars for this transformation.
In contrast, any pair of WFC3/UVIS frames with close
epochs generates an rms of ∼0.7 mas. Such disparity
may imply that the EDR3 positions near the center of
ω Cen have substantially lower accuracy then expected.
For this reason we decided to use the EDR3 positions
only for aligning the seed-frame to the RA and Dec axes
and to derive the WFC3/UVIS pixel scale in the F606W
filter.

To align the seed frame it had to be rotated by 149.◦751
around the location of star 227418 (Table 7 Bellini et al.
2017). At this stage we decided to use the Bellini et al.
(2017) numbering system to designate our sources since
it covers the same area. Also, the availability of celes-
tial coordinates in both data-sets make it easy to cross-
identify the sources. Our estimate of the WFC3/UVIS
pixel scale is 39.770 mas and is not corrected for the ve-
locity aberration. As noted by Bellini et al. (2011); An-
derson (2007) the effect of velocity aberration changes
only the pixel scale. In this sense, our pixel scale is not
absolute.

Next, all frames were converted into pixel-based coor-
dinates of the seed-frame using a least-squares minimiza-
tion. The number of common stars in the magnitude
range 15.4 < F606W < 17.5 span from 1093 to 2434 de-
pending on the dither pattern and the HST roll angle.
If the pixel coordinates are free of geometric distortions,
then a linear 3-term polynomial should be sufficient to
align any pair of frames. Our analysis of the residuals
yielded the following results:

• The rms of the residuals is correlated with the
epoch of observations. Early epochs produce low
rms at ∼0.015 pix whereas the last epochs have
values as high as ∼0.22 pix. The significant inter-

precision measurements of basic stellar parameters, it
is implemented in the universal and versatile software
routine hst1pass (Anderson 2022). It also contains 2-D
libraries of empirical PSFs based on specific variations
of the PSF due to the HST thermal breathing and small
changes in the HST focus adjustment to the particular
focus level of each exposure (Anderson & Bedin 2017;
Anderson 2018).

hst1pass produces the catalog of X&Y positions, the
measured flux provided in the instrumental magnitude
and qfit, the quality parameter of the PSF fit. We lim-
ited our sample to measurements with 0.0<qfit≤0.1.
The typical distribution of qfit as a function of instru-
mental magnitude can be found in (Figure 4; Platais
et al. 2015), which shows two easily-separable popula-
tions of artifacts (with larger qfit) and genuine mea-
surements. Our goal is quality, not completeness, and
the applied constraint only selects the very-best mea-
surements. The derived high-precision positions are cor-
rected for geometric distortions (Bellini et al. 2011) and
hst1pass also simultaneously provided celestial coordi-
nate RA & Dec. The WFC3/UVIS geometric distortions
are known to be stable over time (Kozhurina-Platais &
Anderson 2015). Nevertheless, the still-ongoing distor-
tion monitoring is one of the goals in the multi-cycle
WFC3 calibration program.

3.1. Astrometric registration

4

nal velocity dispersion near the center of ω Cen at
0.75 mas yr−1 (Anderson & van der Marel 2010)
is the main reason this increase. Such patterns
are not only detrimental to the astrometric accu-
racy but may also impact the prospects of finding
accelerations.

• Initial solutions using only three linear terms re-
vealed a small (up to 0.05 pix) but persistent
quadratic pattern in the residuals, mainly along
the Y -axis. Unfortunately, we do not know
whether the seed-frame itself is free from quadratic
markings. There are a handful of cases with nearly
perfect distribution of residuals but not necessarily
at the same HST roll angle.

• About a dozen frames show atypical box-shaped
distributions of residuals. Since such frames ap-
pear close in time to typical frames, we suspect
that sometime the guiding of HST was not per-
fect, especially for some short exposures used in
this calibration program.

The solution to these issues is a three-pronged ap-

proach:

• Subtract from all X&Y pixel-positions the effect
of proper motion relative to the epoch of the seed-
frame. We subtracted the effect of the known rela-
tive proper motion from each X&Y position at ev-
ery epoch relative to the epoch of the seed-frame.
In practice, the known proper motion is multiplied
by the time difference in years and the result is
subtracted from X&Y . As the result, all positions
have zero proper motion up to its formal precision.
Then, these positions are averaged and the mean is
subtracted. In essence, our approach levels the po-
sitional accuracy over all epochs. This can be seen
in Figure 2 in the even scatter of residuals in time.
At each epoch we calculate the amount of this ef-
fect and convert it into pixels using exact scale
at 40 mas per pixel and then rotate around the
adopted zeropoint at Xc=2073.19 and Yc=2292.38
pix using the HST position angle P A V 3. Since
the proper motion is strictly vectorial, it cannot af-
fect the inferred acceleration. The opposite, how-
ever, is true: acceleration can bias the inferred
proper motion.

• The modified pixel coordinates Xm, Ym are then
translated into the system of the seed-frame po-
sitions by a least-squares regression using a poly-
nomial model with 6 terms (linear and quadratic)
for both axes (e.g., Bellini et al. 2014). The output

are epoch positions Xf , Yf free of proper-motion
effects to the level of their accuracy. For sources of
particular interest, e.g. with likely acceleration sig-
nals, we also subtracted a small local offset in both
coordinates by using all sources within ∼ 50 pix-
els around the target and at all epochs. Then the
averages of these offsets are applied to all epochs.

• A total of 17 epochs are excluded from the final
analysis, the recalculation of proper motion, and
the search for acceleration. It is most likely that at
these epochs HST experienced jitter in its pointing
stability due to the degrading gyro (Anderson &
Sabbi 2018). There is no sharp divide between
the normal jitter (∼ 11 mas) and the increased
ones. We note that such HST calibration frames
may not be science grade but still can be used
for engineering purpose. Hence they are in the
MAST.

4. LONG-PERIOD ACCELERATIONS

The new astrometric catalog includes 162,604 sources
down to mF 606W ≃ 21.5. We examined the parameter
space so that it is optimal for the detection of acceler-
ations. The suitable limits appear to be at mF 606W
16.1 − 20.0 mag and no less then 120 epochs evenly
spread over 13 years. There are 22,466 such sources.
Each set of Xf ,Yf then is used to calculate small addi-
tional proper motion and acceleration which can be ap-
proximated by the quadratic term in each axis, X 2 and
Y 2. Thus, the output of the least-squares minimization
yields two formal accelerations along each axis, named
ξ−2
X and ξ−2
(see Table 1). The crucial parameter is the
ratio the acceleration term and its formal error, desig-
nated as QX and QY . This ratio (ignoring the sign)
should be at least ∼5 in one or both axis (see QX and
QY in Table 1 and Figure 2). With this criterion we find
four clear cases of astrometric acceleration discovered in
a globular cluster.

Y

Using a smaller threshold of 3-5 on the Q-parameter
generates ∼400 candidates, but these are heavily pol-
luted by impostors. A typical example is an offset or
unusual spread at some narrow bunch of epochs in the
same HST program. Generally, our search is limited by
the known noise-floor of geometric-distortion corrections
at ∼0.3 mas (Bellini et al. 2011).

In addition, the long-period acceleration of source
233697 was detected in the independent periodogram
analysis of the astrometric time-series, see Section 6.
Among the astrometric accelerations this source has the
shortest period at 8.8 yrs. Due to the complete orbit
and more, the quadratic term will diminish or may even
flip its sign.

In the absence of any information other than the pho-
tometry, their mass can only be estimated via theoreti-
cal isochrones (Serenelli et al. 2021). For instance, one
can simply select the isochrone with the most appro-
priate value of age and metallicity, then shift it to the
appropriate distance modulus and foreground reddening
and then read the stellar mass from the isochrone that
is closest to the observed star in the color-magnitude
diagram (CMD).

In the case of ω Cen this procedure is complicated
due to the wide range of metallicity (see e.g. Frinchaboy
et al. 2002). Indeed, if we take a 12-Gyr isochrone with
the mean metallicity of ω Cen, namely [Fe/H]= −1.53,
and relocate it to the distance of 5.24 kpc (Soltis et al.
2021) and redden it by E(B − V ) = 0.132 mag (cf. Bono
et al. 2019), then the high-acceleration stars clearly fall
to the red, meaning that they are probably more metal
rich.

In order to create a more realistic model for these
stars, we simulated a cluster composed of single stars
only, with an age of 12 Gyr and using the entire distri-

(black points) would cluster around a straight line in both
axes. As an example of borderline acceleration is star 317591
in X-axis. This star would be rejected if not the prominent
acceleration in the Y -axis.

We inspected the F606W photometric timeseries and
found them to be stable with robust scatter estimates
(Lindegren et al. 2012) of between 14 and 42 mmag,
without noticeable correlations with the acceleration sig-
nals.

tinguishable from normal stars.
Its Keplerian motion was
detected in the periodogram (Figure 7). Green line indicates
zero offset, although a careful inspection shows small outbal-
ances within 1 mas.

5. MASSES OF VISIBLE COMPONENTS FROM

STELLAR EVOLUTIONARY MODELS

Three of the cluster members with high accelera-
tion are clearly main sequence stars located just below
the turn-off of ω Cen, see Fig. 4, and the fourth one
(ID=233697) is on the sub-giant branch.

ters, but that it was confirmed by the high-resolution
spectroscopy from APOGEE (M´esz´aros et al. 2021).
This simulation contains a tail of metal-rich stars ex-
tending far enough to the red and cover our four accel-
erating stars (see left panel in Fig. 5).

To estimate the masses of the four visible components
with high acceleration, we proceed as follows: For every

star in the simulation with color c and magnitude m, a
weight wi is assigned as

wi = exp[−(ci − c0)2/σ2 − (mi − m0)2/σ2]

(1)

where (c0, m0) is the color-magnitude position of the
visible components, and σ = 0.02 mag is the typi-
cal photometric error for both color and magnitude.
These weights reflect the likelihood that the color-
magnitude location of the observed stars derive from
the theoretically-predicted location plus a Gaussian dis-
tribution of photometric errors. These weights are used
together with the masses and metallicities of the sim-
ulated stars, to build the probability density functions
(PDF) for both mass and metallicity. These functions
are depicted in the central and right panels of Fig. 5.
From these PDFs, we then derive the median and 68%
confidence (1σ-equivalent) intervals for both mass and
metallicity. Their values are listed in Table 2.

Table 2 initially presents the values obtained by as-
suming the standard reference to the distance of ω Cen
(5.24±0.11 kpc; Soltis et al. 2021) based on Gaia EDR3
parallaxes. The error in distance modulus in this case is
of just 0.004 mag, which is one fifth of the error we al-
ready assume in our derivation of the masses and metal-
licities, and hence not able to significantly affect our esti-
mations. However, there are alternative values to ω Cen
distance that are worth exploring. The review of GC
distances by Baumgardt & Vasiliev (2021), for instance,
provides a 5.426 ± 0.047 kpc distance; these authors ar-
gue that the Gaia parallaxes have small-scale correlated
errors and systematic biases but this is not well yet un-
derstood in EDR3, particularly for ω Cen. The bottom
part of Table 2 presents the mass and metallicity esti-
mates that are obtained with this distance value. As
it can be appreciated, changes in the mass values are
smaller than 0.01M⊙.

En passant, we note that the location of our high-
acceleration stars on the simulated CMD indicate that
the metallicities of these stars are higher than the mean
value of ω Cen [Fe/H]= −1.53 (see Table 2).

6. PERIODOGRAMS OF ASTROMETRIC

TIME-SERIES

To search for deviations from the linear astrometric
motion expected for a single source, we processed the
two-dimensional astrometric timeseries as follows. For
every source we subtracted the average position from
the timeseries and fitted a four-parameter linear model
corresponding to two positional offsets and two proper
motions. This analysis is therefore independent of the
amount of proper-motion displacement subtracted in the
pre-processing and analysis discussed in Sect. 3.1. We

Finally, we identified several sources with long-period
periodogram peaks and small FAP whose origin is gen-
uine Keplerian motion.

period for the ∼160 000 sources for which the periodogram
could be computed. The two vertical lines are at periods of
0.5 and 1 year. The black stars indicate the location of the
five sources in Table 1.

6.1. Constraints on the orbital parameters and masses

of the companions

For the sources identified in the previous section on
the basis of their small periodogram FAP, we attempted
to derive constraints on the possible orbital parameters.
One source (143023) turned out to be a foreground bi-
nary and is discussed in Appendix A. The periodograms
of the astrometric timeseries residuals for the remaining
four sources are shown in Fig. 7. All of them except
233697 show a dominant peak at roughly the observa-
tion timespan with a large tail towards longer periods.
This is typical for astrometric data that cover only a
small or moderate portion of the astrometric orbit. This
is also evident when inspecting the timeseries in Fig. 2.
For source 233697, whose timeseries is shown in Fig. 3,
the periodogram peak is at ∼ 3230 days (8.85 yrs) with
an observation timespan of ∼4730 days (12.96 yrs), in-
dicating that more than one orbital revolution has been
observed.

We analyse the data of these sources under the as-
sumption that the non-standard motion is caused by a
single dark companion in a Keplerian orbit about the
visible source. In three out of four cases, the observa-
tion time-span is too short to derive tight constraints
on the orbital parameters and we therefore attempt to
determine the range of possible configurations and their
astrophysical interpretations.

For every source we use kepmodel to fit the data with
the initial four-parameter model plus a 7-parameter Ke-
plerian model with initial parameters estimated from
the periodogram. The orbit-fitting results are therefore

tiny dots), built to estimate the masses and metallicities of
the four visible components with high acceleration (coloured
dots). The central and right panels show the probability den-

derived from the stars with similar color–magnitude position
in the simulation (see text for details).

omitted the parallax term because we do not expect to
measure the parallax signal for cluster members, due to
the inherently relative nature of our astrometric mea-
surements.

We then computed the periodogram of the fit resid-
uals using the kepmodel package (Delisle & S´egransan
2022). The period and false-alarm probability (FAP)
of the highest periodogram peak were retained and are
shown in Figure 6. The FAP indicates the probability
that the peak is caused by random noise, i.e. a small
FAP indicates the presence of periodicity in the time-
series. The lower and upper boundaries of the periodic-
ity search were 10 days and 20 000 days, respectively.

Most sources exhibit insignificant periodogram peaks
with large FAP, and we performed detailed analysis for
all sources with small FAP. A few sources show signif-
icant signals with periods of one year or half a year.
These are likely foreground sources for which measur-
able parallax offsets are present. The list of sources
with FAP < 10−10 and periods around half a year
is 420482, 414263, 396157, 421049, 421381, 427775,
428247, 428253, 428571, 434388, 412665, 421379,
421520, 427880, 396159, 421074. The list of sources with
FAP < 10−10 and periods around one year is 247164,
276969, 109223, 87685, 387712, 116672, 107882, 312186.
As a by-product of our analysis, we have therefore iden-
tified 24 sources that probably are foreground sources
and not members of the Omega Cen cluster.

The pile-up at long periods is caused by the upper
boundary of the period search. Some of these peaks
have small FAP but visual inspection of the time-series
revealed systematic offsets and/or few measurements in
the astrometric timeseries. The same applies to the few
short-period (P < 100 day) sources and to the small-
FAP source at P ∼ 10 yr visible in Figure 6.

independent of the amount of proper-motion displace-
ment subtracted in the pre-processing (Sect. 3.1). We
do not impose priors on any of the parameters but we
set an upper limit of 0.3 to the eccentricity for 143023
and 317591. For the remaining sources that limit is 0.95.
This is to avoid high-eccentricity solutions which often
are preferred in orbit-fitting results using incomplete or-
bital coverage or otherwise sub-optimal sampling. We
assigned a uniform uncertainty of 0.3 mas to every indi-
vidual astrometric measurement, which is motivated by
the distortion-correction noise floor. This choice is val-
idated by the typical value of an additional jitter term,
which we included in the model. The model fitting is
always performed on the individual-frame data, hence
no binning is applied. For visual display, however, we

compute normal points as averages of individual frames
grouped in time.

We fit the combined model with a standard maximum-
likelihood algorithm and report a few of the best-fit pa-
rameters in Table 3, which has some caveats:

• The algorithm tends to converge towards the
smallest period compatible with the data set.
However, the true period of the system may be
much longer which influences the estimated pa-
rameters of companion.

• For two sources we applied the e < 0.3 constraint.
The true eccentricities may be larger than 0.3,
which can imply larger semi-major axe and, there-
fore, companion mass estimates. Table 3 also
shows the solution parameters for larger eccentric-
ities. For 143023 a larger eccentricity results in a
larger semimajor axis and longer period, but the
companion mass is nearly unchanged. For 317591
a larger eccentricity results in a longer period and
larger companion mass, but the semimajor axis is
nearly unchanged.

• When inferring the companion mass, we assumed
one single dark companion. This assumption may
not be justified, which we discuss below. The
alternative scenarios include a pair of quasi-dark
companions or a companion object that is not dark
but contributes significant light. In the latter case,
the mass of that companion has to be even larger
than what we inferred.

The uncertainties of orbital period P , eccentricity e, and
semi-major axis of the primary a1 (Table 3) correspond
to the formal uncertainties returned by the minimisation
routine and are indicative only. The companion mass
M2 was estimated from the orbital parameters and an
average of the primary-mass estimates M1 in Table 21,
with uncertainties propagated using Monte-Carlo resam-
pling.

Since several of these orbits are not fully covered by
our data and both proper motions and orbital parame-
ters are free parameters in the fitted model, it can hap-
pen that proper motion is mistaken for orbital motion
and vice versa. This is however not the case for our
solutions. We verified that the residual proper motion
determined as part of the orbital fit is comparable to or
smaller than its uncertainties. This is important to safe-
guard against potential instabilities in the fitting routine

1 The systematic primary-mass uncertainty has insignificant influ-

ence on the results.

rian offsets compensate each other.

Although the systematic and formal uncertainties are
significant, we can categorize the four binaries into two
groups: 233697 and 317591 are probably systems with
similar component masses, whereas the solutions for
212028 and 290133 indicate companions that appear to
be significantly more massive than the primary star, but
yet might be much dimmer.

The secondary masses in Table 3 were derived un-
der the assumption that the companion is dark, i.e. the
positions of the system’s photocentre and the primary
coincide. The semimajor axis of the photocentre mo-
tion aphoto that we determine directly is then equal to
the semimajor axis of the primary’s barycentric motion
a1 = aphoto. If the companion contributes light, the pho-
tocentre motion gets diluted and a1 > aphoto which im-
plies an even larger mass of the companion. The scaling
between a binary’s photocentre and barycentre orbit size
is determined by the fractional mass f = M2/(M1 +M2)
of the components and their fractional luminosity β =
L2/(L1 + L2) (Heintz 1978):

¯aphoto = ¯arel(f − β),

(2)

where ¯aphoto is the photocentre orbit size in linear units
and ¯arel is the semimajor axis of the relative orbit in
linear units. Using Kepler’s third law in SI units this
can be written as

¯aphoto = 3(cid:112)GP 2/(4π2) 3(cid:112)

M1 + M2(f − β)

(3)

and therefore

aphoto ∝ ¯aphoto ∝ 3(cid:112)

M1 + M2

(cid:18) M2

M1 + M2

−

.

(4)
From Eq. 4 it is clear that to maintain the observed
aphoto constant between the dark companion limit
(where L2 = 0 and a1 = aphoto) and a luminous com-
panion with L2 > 0, the companion mass M2 has to
increase.

With the data available to us we cannot exclude that
the companions contribute light, but if they do it implies
that they are fainter and at the same time more massive
than the primary.

Two configurations that could satisfy these constraints
for HSToC-2 and HSToC-4, which have the largest es-
timated companion masses, are (a) the companion is a
tight pair of white dwarfs (see Section 8) or (b) the com-
panion is a tight pair of main-sequence stars. We sim-
ulated the latter configuration by generating synthetic
triple systems that have the same astrometric signature
in terms of period but are composed of a primary with

9

properties from Table 2 and a twin-binary companion
of the same metallicity with individual masses between
∼0.4–0.8 M⊙. Using the isochrones discussed in Section
5 and Eq. 2 we found that the corresponding photocen-
ter orbit size is largest when the total companion mass is
∼1 M⊙, but that it remains 0.2 − 0.25 mas smaller than
the measured orbit size. This scenario therefore seems
excluded for HSToC-4 and unlikely for HSToC-2.

6.2. Orbital motion of 290133/HSToC-4

The source 290133 stands out as having the largest es-
timated companion mass. We show the orbital motion
of 290133 in the plane of the sky in Figure 8 and as a
function of time in Figure 9. For the sake of better visu-
alisation only, we computed averages over time-bins of
∼100 days (normal points). We stress that these figures
show only one possible realisation of the orbital parame-
ters, the actual orbit may look different. However, these
visualisations are useful to ascertain the Keplerian or-
bital motion.

In Figure 9 it can be appreciated that the excess sig-
nal after subtracting parallax and proper motion has a
standard deviation of 0.51 mas (both axes, computed
on normal points) which is reduced to 0.25 mas when
including the Keplerian model. The equivalent figures
for the other sources are shown in Figures 15, 17, and
16 of the Appendix.

6.3. Gaia catalogues in ω Cen

In the Gaia DR3 source catalog there are no counter-
parts to the binary sources listed in Table 1 when we
impose a maximum separation of 5′′, a Gaia magnitude
mG < 20 and magnitude difference |mV − mG| < 2, and
the presence of a Gaia parallax measurement.

On 10 October 2023, however, Gaia published a Fo-
cused Product Release (FPR) that includes an cata-
logue of additional sources in ω Cen (Gaia Collabo-
In that catalogue (Gaia archive

table gaiafpr.crowded field source, epoch J2017.5),
we found unique positional matches to all five sources
within a radius of 30 mas. We did not correct for proper
motion between the DR1 and FPR epochs. The details
of these matched sources are given in Table 4. They
have small magnitude differences |mV − mG| < 0.3 mag
and the next closest positional matches are at separa-
tions ≳ 0.3′′. We briefly explore the properties of these
Gaia data here.

Figure 10 shows the FPR ‘astrometric excess noise‘
(AEN) parameter for our binaries in comparison with
roughly comparable sources in that catalogue. This
parameter corresponds to a jitter term that is added
quadratically to the individual Gaia measurement un-
certainties to account for the residual scatter in the

single-source astrometric solution (Lindegren et al.
2021). Without access to the Gaia astrometric time-
series it is a powerful metric to identify and sometimes
even characterise astrometric binaries (e.g. Kiefer et al.
2019; Belokurov et al. 2020; Gandhi et al. 2022).

Whereas HSToC-1/143023, HSToC-3/233697, and
HSToC-5/317591 exhibit values close to the mode of the
distribution, HSToC-2/212028 and HSToC-4/290133
show elevated levels of Gaia excess noise. These lat-
ter sources are also the ones with the larger orbital
signatures (a1 ≃ 0.9 mas) inferred from the HST data
compared to HSToC-3 and HSToC-5 with a1 ≃ 0.5 mas.
This is a strong indication that the Gaia FPR is sensi-
tive to orbital motion with amplitudes of ∼1 mas in ω
Cen.

tracting the standard model (top panels) as a function of

middle and bottom panels. The top and middle panel show

whereas the bottom panels show individual frame data. Left
panels are in RA direction and right panels are in Declina-
tion.

binaries.

The foreground source HSToC-1 does, however, not
match that pattern since we estimated an orbit size of
∼0.9 mas, but its AEN is unremarkable. This may be
due to the long (and uncertain) period of this binary
compared to the FPR timespan of 5 years, which re-
duces the probability that orbital acceleration shows up
as elevated AEN.

It is evident in Figure 10 that there are many sources
with AEN values similar or even much larger than
HSToC-3 and HSToC-5. A fraction of those are likely
of instrumental origin, e.g. source blending, but another
fraction could indicate acceleration signals. Using the
Gaia FPR astrometric excess noise may therefore be a
promising avenue for the discovery of new astrometric
binaries in ω Cen, especially in regions not covered by
the HST observations.

7. MUSE OBSERVATIONS

The sources 212028 and 290133 are covered by the
footprint of the mosaic observed with MUSE (Bacon
et al. 2010) as part of the survey of Galactic globular
clusters presented in Kamann et al. (2018). The qual-
ity cuts routinely performed prior to searches for bi-
nary stars (see Giesers et al. 2019) result in sets of six
radial velocity (RV) measurements for 212028 and five
RV measurements for 290133, with typical uncertain-
ties of > 10 km s−1 for the former and 5 − 10 km s−1 for
the latter. None of the stars shows signs of variability
in the MUSE data. However, given the relative large
uncertainties compared to the expected velocity semi-
amplitudes (Table 3), this does not seem unexpected.

We note that the spatial resolution of the MUSE data,
with a typical FWHM of ∼ 0.8 arcsec, is lower com-
pared to the HST data by a factor of ∼8. Therefore,
even though the stars are bright enough to perform ac-
curate RV measurements with MUSE, crowding limits
our abilities to do so. Both sources have similarly bright
stars located at about 0.5× the FWHM and significantly
brighter neighbours at distances of ∼ 1′′. Future obser-
vations with the MUSE narrow field mode will be able
to overcome this problem.

8. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE STUDIES

The largest Milky Way globular cluster ω Cen now is
the first cluster with detected astrometric accelerations.
Whether or not the relatively small range of the deduced
masses of the invisible components is typical for Milky
Way globular clusters remains to be answered by future
studies. However, we can get some cues from another
rare populations such as millisecond pulsars (MSP) and
X-ray sources. Curiously, the first bona fide MSPs in
ω Cen were discovered only in 2020 (Dai et al. 2020)
followed by observations with the MeerKAT radio tele-
scope and discovery of 13 more MSPs (Chen et al. 2023).
Four of them are in our field (Figure 11).

Since MSPs and neutron stars share the same phys-
ical phenomenon observed in different wavelengths, we
inspected the known binary systems anywhere in the sky
with well-measured component masses (Table 1 ¨Ozel &

Freire 2016). These binary systems yield fairly-tight
mass limits of 1.38 ± 0.05M ⊙. Two of our targets,
212028 and 290133, fit very well to these mass limits
and thus provide a strong argument that their invisible
component could be a neutron star.
In fact, the esti-
mated properties of these two systems are very similar
in luminosity, acceleration, component masses, and Ke-
plerian parameters such as the semi-major axis.

An alternative option for the nature of these compan-
ions would be a tight pair of white dwarfs, but such
a scenario may not be effective in the cores of globu-
lar clusters. The presence of MSPs in our field itself is
auspicious to the neutron star scenario.

Old stellar systems such as globular clusters contain
low-luminosity X-ray sources. The most comprehensive
rework of archival ω Cen observations with the Chandra
X-ray Observatory Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrom-
eter provide the best sample of these sources (Henley-
willis et al. 2018). There are 14 X-ray sources within
the boundaries of our field. None of them is close to the
detected astrometric binaries. In globular clusters the
typical X-ray sources are cataclysmic variables (Belloni
& Rivera 2021). They are relatively tight binaries com-
posed of a white dwarf or a neutron star and a main
sequence star as donor. Our field has four cataclysmic
variables but their potential semi-major axis would be
totally imperceptible.

ter of the gnomonic projection is the best-known kinematic

program stars. Red points are oue newly-discovered binaries.

Including archival HST ACS/WFC images of
ways.
ω Cen taken prior to WFC3/UVIS images and accu-
mulating more data from the ongoing WFC3/UVIS cal-
ibration program will expand the time baseline of the
observations and therefore lead to better constraints on
the binaries’ orbital and mass parameters.

Independently, one could experiment with relaxing the
conservative cutoff value for the image quality parameter
qfit to increase the number of available measurements
per source, hence potentially increase sensitivity.

Access to the epoch positions Xf ,Yf , free of the effect
of proper motions using Bellini et al. (2017) data, and
new calibrated magnitudes will be granted upon request
to the authors and made available through the SciServer
platform.

Further exploration of the Gaia FPR dataset of ω Cen
has the potential to lead to the discovery of additional
binaries in this cluster.

9. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This study is trailblazing astrometric acceleration
searches in a relatively distant globular cluster popu-
lated by roughly solar- and subsolar-mass sources. We
demonstrated the viability of this project by obtaining
high-precision astrometric timeseries for tens of thou-
sands of sources, thereby improving the proper motions
of more than 22,000 cluster members with an average
precision of 0.011 mas yr−1. We discovered five new bi-
naries, one in the foreground and four cluster-members,
and characterised their Keplerian motion.

Despite the large distance of ω Cen of over 5 kpc we
were able to detect the first astrometric binaries. Those
have very-small orbital semi-major axes below one 1 mas
(Table 3). These binaries have periods longer than our
survey timespan, except for HSToC-3, where we ob-
served more than one Keplerian orbit allowing us to de-
rive better constraints on the mass of the companion.
Inspection of the Gaia FPR dataset of ω Cen indepen-
dently supports the discovery of the larger-amplitude
binaries HSToC-2 and HSToC-4, which have elevated
levels of Gaia astrometric excess noise.

Our preliminary best-fit mass estimates for the in-
visible companions in ω Cen range from ∼0.7M⊙ to
∼1.4M⊙ and from ∼0.6M⊙ to ∼2.1M⊙ if we account
for the associated 1-σ uncertainties. The true range of
allowed companion masses is likely even larger, but there
are essentially three likely scenarios of their nature: a

13

single white dwarf2, a pair of white dwarfs, or a neu-
tron star. Because of the uncertainties in our estimates
and the Chandrasekhar limit on the maximum mass of
white dwarfs at 1.4 M⊙, we are unable to pinpoint the
most-likely scenario.

Our initial goal was to probe the existence of stellar-
mass black holes in binaries of ω Cen. Although we have
not unambiguously identified a BH candidate, we have
demonstrated that surveys like ours are sufficiently sen-
sitive to discover them if they exist. A system akin to
Gaia BH2 at the distance of ω Cen generates an astro-
metric signal with a semi-amplitude of ∼0.9 mas and a
period of 3.5 years, which lies well within the sensitivity
limit of our survey, cf. Table 3. Shorter period systems
akin to Gaia BH1 would generate a signal of ∼0.25 mas
and a period of 0.5 years, thus are more challenging to
detect.

in ω Cen is at mF 606W ∼22 mag which is ∼4 mag fainter than
the faint limit of our binaries.

APPENDIX

A. THE FOREGROUND BINARY STAR HSToC-1

The astrometry periodogram of source HSToC-1/143023 after fitting the four-parameter linear model reveals a strong
signature at a one-year period which persists in the residuals of tentative orbit-model fits. This is a strong indication
that this is a foreground source whose un-modelled parallax motion introduces the periodicity. We therefore computed
the parallax factors using the formalism provided by van de Kamp (1981) and then fitted the standard five-parameter
model. As shown in Fig. 12 this cancels the power at one year. We therefore modelled the astrometry of this source
with models that include the parallax term.

To estimate the potential orbital parameters, we modelled the data with the combination of the standard five-
parameter model and a single Keplerian model with initial parameters compatible with the highest periodogram-peak.
Since the orbital motion is only partially covered (Fig. 2) we can only determine a lower limit to the period and give
indicative bounds to the possible mass range of the companion. Since orbital eccentricity is essentially unconstrained
at this point, we limited its allow range to <0.3 (see Table 3).

One possible orbital solution with a period of ∼ 7000 days is shown in Fig. 13. However, the orbital period could be
as short as the ∼ 4000 day timespan of the data or much longer. The orbital motion and fit residuals for this solution
as a function of time are shown in Figure 14.

The determined parallax of the system is almost independent of the orbital parameters because the timescales are
very different for such long-period systems. We determined a relative parallax of ϖrel = 0.55 ± 0.12 mas. Since that is

Figure 12. Residual periodogram of the four- (top) and five-parameter (bottom) models for HSToC-1/143023. The power at
long period is hardly affected but including the parallax in the model makes the power around 365 days disappear.

measured relative to cluster members, we need to account for the cluster distance of 5.24 kpc (Soltis et al. 2021) and
obtain an absolute parallax of HSToC-1 of ϖabs = 0.73 ± 0.12 mas.

Adopting this latter parallax value, and assuming that the HSToC-1 primary is a metal-poor halo star with the
same foreground extinction as ω Cen, its placement in theoretical isochrones provides a mass estimate in the range
between 0.65 and 0.71 M⊙. Assuming a primary mass of 0.68 , the companion mass for this particular solution would
be ∼0.15M⊙, where we neglect any light contribution by the companion, which could dilute the photocentre motion
and lead to an underestimation of the companion mass (Table 3).
