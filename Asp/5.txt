Context: Episodic accretion plays an important role during the early phases of star-formation. The main processes responsible
for the episodic accretion events remain, however, unclear.
Aims: Our main objective is to investigate the properties of FUors and EXors by analysing observational data, along with
numerical hydrodynamics simulations of protostellar disks, stellar evolution models of outbursting stars and thermo-chemical
models of star–disk systems in the outburst state. Our goal is to get a better understanding of the outburst processes and their
respective origin.
Methods: We used the radiation thermo-chemical code ProDiMo (PROtoplanetary DIsk MOdel) to match the dust emission
and gas emission lines originating from the environment surrounding the FUor star Re 50 N IRS 1. Our model focusses on
the observational data obtained by Herschel and Spitzer while we use archival photometry to complete the spectral energy
distribution.
Results: The modelling shows that the object is composed of a complex combination of several heating sources with different
spatial distribution. Our model uses a massive envelope with an mass infall rate of 1.35 ×10−5 M⊙ yr−1 to explain the continuum
emission in the (sub-)mm regime. At the same time we fit the CO and 13CO ladders from 60 µm to 650 µm along with the two
[O i] lines centered at 63.18 and 145.53 µm. To explain the strong CO emission at shorter wavelengths and the oxygen lines, we
require a very warm disk due to a high disk accretion rate reaching 6 ×10−4 M⊙ yr−1 and an additional UV field of 3% of the
overall emission to heat the disk.

Introduction

Episodic accretion is recognized to play a central role in the
accretion history of young stars. One of the most outstanding
examples of episodic accretion are FUors, named after the
archetype FU Orionis, which are low-mass young stars that
experience strong optical outbursts that can last several decades.
FU Orionis had its outburst in 1936, reaching an increase of 6
mag in the B-band at the peak, and has since then been slowly
fading (Kenyon et al. 2000). A few dozens of objects with
similar behaviour have been identified since the outburst of
FU Ori (Hartmann & Kenyon 1996; Reipurth & Aspin 2010).
There have also been detections of some candidates (Quanz
et al. 2007; Semkov & Peneva 2010; Reipurth et al. 2012;
Fischer et al. 2012; Fischer et al. 2013) that have not been
observed in the pre-outburst state, which however show typical
characteristics of FUors. FUors appear to be predominantly
protostars which still accrete from their parental envelopes or
are in the early T-Tauri star phase with only a remnant envelope.
Characteristic of FUors are the very strong outbursts, with a
luminosity change from 4 to 6 mag which occur on timescales
of days to weeks and last for several decades. Another type
of eruptive low-mass stars is characterised by weaker (3 to
5 mag) and shorter outbursts which however can occur more
frequently (Herbig 1989). EX Lupi is the archetype of this
second class, which is accordingly called EXors. There are
indications that these objects are more evolved than FUors, but

the transition between the two classes may be smooth (Audard
et al. 2014). The formation of massive stars also diplays signa-
tures of episodic accretion (e.g. De Wit et al. 2017; Meyer et al.
2017), suggesting that this phenomenon is somewhat universal
among star formation.

A number of investigations at the infrared and the sub-
millimeter regimes during the recent years finally allowed ac-
cessing of the dust emission and lines of FUors and EXors in
this wavelength range, which provided insights into the cir-
cumstellar disk and possible envelopes around these objects
(Lorenzetti 2005, Green et al. 2013b). It was found to be ex-
tremely common that young stars show activity in the form
of significant IR variability. The inner regions of FUors and
EXors, which are of high interest to reveal the origin of an
outburst, are challenging for single-dish observations as these
phenomena cannot be proven unambiguously to occur in the
inner disk alone. Recent studies with the Atacama Large Mil-
limeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array (JVLA) opened a new window for investigations
of the outburst objects with very high spatial resolution and
allowed the observation of hot inner disks (Liu et al. 2017),
density waves in the disks (P´erez et al. 2016), outflows of the
objects (Ru´ız-Rodr´ıguez et al. 2017a,b), and shifts of the snow
line during outburst (Cieza et al. 2016).

The origin of accretion bursts is still unclear and could be
caused by viscous-thermal and/or magnetorotational instabil-
ities that form in the inner disk, tidal effects caused by close

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
companions or close flybys of external stars, or accretion of
gaseous clumps in gravitationally unstable disks (see Audard
et al. 2014 for a review). We aim to investigate the properties
of FUors and EXors by analysing observational data (Postel
et al. 2019), along with numerical hydrodynamics simulations
of protostellar disks (Vorobyov & Basu 2015), stellar evolu-
tion models of outbursting stars (Elbakyan et al. 2019) and
thermo-chemical models of star–disk systems in the outburst
state (Rab et al. 2017). The goal of our project is to get a better
understanding of the outburst processes and their respective
origin.

In this paper, we focus on the FUor-like object Re 50 N
IRS 1 and present the results of a ProDiMo model (ProDiMo
is a radiation thermo-chemical code to model protoplanetary
disks) during a re-brightening phase. Interestingly, Chiang et al.
2015 proposed that the object is going through a dust clearing
phase in the optical and near-IR. Focussing on mid-/far-IR and
sub-mm data, we analyse what Herschel and Spitzer observa-
tions can tell us in the constraints of the model. ProDiMo has
been extended to handle envelope structures (Rab et al. 2017),
allowing it to not only model T-Tauri stars but also the earlier
evolutionary stages like FUors and EXors.

The main questions we aim to answer in this paper are how
the gas lines of the object can be modelled and where they
come from, as well as whether the envelope plays a special
role in the scenario of Re 50 N IRS 1 and if we need episodic
accretion to explain the observational data.

cross. The beam of the longest used wavelength is illustrated by the circle in
the lower left corner. We used a log scaling and removed values below zero.

1.1 Re 50 N IRS 1
Re 50 N IRS 1 / HBC 494 is a known FUor-like object (Audard
et al. 2014) in the Orion A cloud, which is 414±7 pc (Menten
et al. 2007) away from us, with a wide spread (Großschedl et al.
2018) based on Galactic longitude. The object has a bolometric
luminosity of 90 L⊙, based on the SED of our recent work in
Postel et al. (2019). It was observed in the past with several
instruments, covering the SED from the optical to the mm
range with photometry and spectra, including Herschel (Sep
2013), Spitzer (7 Nov 2008) and ALMA (Aug 2015, see Ru´ız-
Rodr´ıguez et al. 2017b) observations. Our Herschel data shows
many emission lines of Re 50 N IRS 1, mainly from CO from
low to high excitation temperatures, which makes the object a
promising candidate for detailed modelling. The object shows
strong silicate absorption in the bending and stretching bands
and CO2 absorption. Re 50 N IRS 1 is known for its very wide
outflow, detected by ALMA, and strong diffuse emission in two
Herschel instruments (PACS/SPIRE: 60-671 µm) extending to
in the northeast and to the west, see Fig. 1.

2 Methods

The radiation thermo-chemical code, ProDiMo (see Kamp et al.
2017, Thi et al. 2011, Woitke et al. 2009, Woitke et al. 2016),

solves the temperature, chemical abundances and radiation
field in a self-consistent way under constraints of axisymmetric
distribution of gas and dust in two dimensions. The protostar is
presented by a point source with corresponding luminosity in
the center of the structure, surrounded by a protoplanetary disk
and spherical envelope with outflow cavities. The code is used
to derive atomic and molecular abundances in different regions
of the modelled object, and calculate the spectral lines (both in
emission and absorption) and the spectral energy distribution
(SED). This model was already used in Rab et al. 2017, where a
detailed explanation, about how the disk and envelope structure
is built, is explained. In White et al. 2019 this model was used
to fit APEX data with 3 lines but without Herschel data. More
details about the disk accretion heating are shown in Appendix
A.

3 Modelling

The procedure to find a good matching model can be separated
in three steps. The first phase was to check the literature for
already determined parameters. After that we matched the
SED with ProDiMo. Once this was done, we matched the
gas emission lines. We investigated several configurations in
ProDiMo to probe a large parameter space. In Table 1, we
provide the parameters of the model that we consider fits best

the Re 50 N IRS 1 gas lines and SED (mainly the Herschel one,
see below).

3.1 Literature

Cieza et al. (2018) derived the dust mass from one ALMA
continuum image. Assuming a gas to dust mass ration of 100,
they estimated the disk mass, which are both used in this work
beside the tapering parameter. We use a reference scale height
of the disk of 10 au which is slightly above the margin of
Cieza et al. (2018). Ru´ız-Rodr´ıguez et al. (2017b) delivered a
measurement with ALMA of the opening angle of the cavity.
Other parameters like the effective temperature of the central
source, the mass infall rate and the disk accretion rate as well
as the amount of the UV radiation were derived in our analysis
which is described later in more detail. Based on photometry
of Herschel (PACS) and Hubble, we estimate the outer radius
of the system of Re 50 N IRS 1 at up to 15,000 au. Within this
distance, there is no significant overlap of the emission of the
object and the nearby reflection nebula. We assume that the line
flux measured by Herschel from this region is not contaminated
by another source for the modelling.

3.2 SED matching

The second step in our analysis was to match the broad-band
SED, while focussing on the Herschel and Spitzer data. With
the SED matching, we obtained better initial conditions for
changing the model parameters and fit the gas emission lines.
This provides constrains for the disk and envelope dust struc-
ture. We varied several parameters while we discuss here the
ones with the biggest impact on the SED. Other parameters
that have been explored but are not discussed in detail are the
luminosity of the central source, effective temperature of the
central source and the cavity opening angle, as their impact
on the SED was very limited. We focussed on Herschel and
Spitzer photometry and spectra between 10-700 µm. The Her-
schel data were observed in 2013 (Postel et al. 2019), before
the object was found to go through a brightening phase (Chiang
et al. 2015). The data in the optical and near-IR, as well as
the major part of the photometry in the sub-mm and mm are
older (1988-2001). We take here the approach that such data,
while informative, do not necessarily correspond to the SED
state during the Herschel observation, and therefore we do not
optimize the parameters to match them. The Herschel data is
therefore used as our benchmark.

The first parameter we started with is the mass infall rate

onto the envelope, as this has the biggest impact on the emission
in the far-IR/sub-mm. In the model of the rotating envelope, this
parameter has no heating effect on the structure. The change of
the SED is shown in Fig. 2. For the mass infall rate for our best
model (blue curve, ˙M ≈ 10−5 M⊙ yr−1) the far-IR/sub-mm data
of Herschel ar matched very well, which was the main goal of
this step, but there is an extreme variation in the wavelength
range of the Spitzer spectrum and for shorter wavelengths when
Mi f is varied. The next step was to match the mid-IR, for which
the inclination of the object had a major impact, which left the
far-IR/sub-mm range mostly unchanged. We show in Fig. 3
the corresponding SED for a variation of the inclination. While
the model predicts higher flux between the Herschel PACS
spectrum and the Spitzer spectrum, a solution for the short
wavelength domain was covered within the parameter space
at an inclination between 10° and 16.25°, which we refine to
15.3°. As the object is embedded and stellar parameters are
mostly unknown, we also ran a grid from 0.1-0.8 M⊙ where
we find minor differences in the SED. The range is reasonable
for such an object, and we eventually use a stellar mass of 0.5
M⊙, however there is potential for large difference to the actual
protostar. We further assume that there is extinction along the
line of sight that is not part of the model. This extinction is set
by the AV parameter. We find that we need some additional
extinction to match the short-wavelength regime. The result
of the entire SED matching process can be seen in Fig. 4, to-
gether with observational data and the spectrum of the protostar
without absorption caused by the envelope and disk.

3.3 Gas emission lines

The next step of our analysis was to match the gas emission
lines detected with Herschel while keeping the SED untouched.
Fig. 5 shows the emission line fluxes from Herschel together
with the ProDiMo modelled fluxes based on the SED-matching
model, with a variation of the stellar luminosity. The emission
lines at long wavelengths (⪆ 300 µm) are matched quite well
by the model, but the shorter wavelength lines, being orders
of magnitudes too low, are not properly reproduced. Since the
short wavelength CO lines, originating from high J transitions,
and the oxygen emission are caused by material which is much
hotter than the material which emits the long wavelength lines,
we increased the effective temperature of the central source
of the model to heat some material further. The result can be
seen in Fig. 6. The impact was negligible. Looking at the gas
temperature, we found that the CO and oxygen of the disk was
simply not getting warm enough, and even raising the effective
temperature of the central source to 12000 K did not help.

We therefore investigated another parameter and introduced
a UV field around the central source, assuming that accretion
shocks near the protostar would create a significant UV radi-
ation field, indicated by the high level of [O i] emission, that
would in turn heat the disk and envelope temperature suffi-
ciently high. The temperature increase was, however, con-

centrated to the surface of the disk and did not lead to more
emission of high J CO lines at some point but photodissoci-
ated the CO. We therefore introduced disk accretion to have a
disk-internal heating process in addition to the UV field. Both
processes, which affect only the gas, are disabled in the default
settings but appear to be a necessity for this particular object.

4 Results

In Fig. 7, we show three different models. Our best match result
of the SED and lines and two other models models (Mdot=0,
fUV=0) to compare the effects of disk accretion and UV field
of the central source: The other two models have either dis-
abled disk accretion but an UV field or disk accretion but no
UV field. Neither the UV field nor the disk accretion heating
mechanism are sufficient to raise the temperature of the disk
high enough to reproduce the observational measurements. We
believe therefore, that the model with both disk mass accretion
and UV field is a better model to match the gas emission lines
and keep the fit of the SED intact.

Figure 2: Change of the SED with different mass infall rates (10−6 − 10−4
M⊙ yr−1) for the envelope. The goal of this grid was to match the far-IR/sub-
mm data. The Herschel and Spitzer spectra which worked as a benchmark for
the SED matching are shown in colors (Spitzer: brown; Herschel PACS: green;
Herschel SPIRE SSW: purple; Herschel SPIRE SLW: red)

4.1 Spectral properties and surrounding emis-

sion

The matching of the SED (Fig. 4) with ProDiMo, mainly the
Herschel and Spitzer data, was precise enough to recreate the
results from the observations reasonably well. At long wave-
lengths there is a difference to some ground based observations.
Also, there is a gap to observational data in the range of 800
nm to 3 µm. These observations were performed before the

only in the envelope. We therefore deduce that Re 50 N IRS 1
must consist of a relatively complex set of temperatures, caused
by multiple heating processes which are spread over a larger
spatial area. In the Fig. 8, the level of the continuum emission
at the respective wavelength (visible in the top left corner of the
panels with CO emission, in micrometer) is shown, in addition
to the area where most of the emission in vertical and radial
direction is created. An important result for observations at
these specific wavelengths. The CO density is strongly reduced
in the envelope in the line of sight with the disk and the central
source, up to a distance of ≈ 4300 au. This effect is caused
by the freeze-out of the CO at low temperature with a weaker
effect at low densities (i.e.
larger distance). Closer to the
outflow cavity, photo-desorption occurs as the UV radiation
can penetrate into then envelope, which is however blocked by
the disk. The behaviour of the CO abundance structure is as
expected, see Rab et al. (2017) for more details.

4.2 Rotational diagrams

Fig. 10 shows the rotational diagram for CO emission for our
best model and the Herschel observation of the object. This
figure is an alternative way to show the line emission from
Fig. 7, but in a normalized way. The diagram can be used to
obtain the excitation temperatures by measuring the slope of the
curve, and column density of the gas by measuring the offset for
observational dat (see Goldsmith & Langer 1999, Green et al.
2013a, Dionatos et al. 2013). The figure shows that the slope,
i.e. the temperature distribution of the curve is matched by the
model. However, we can see that the column density of the
model is slightly higher than what we observed. The approach
to split the emission lines into three domains with assumed LTE
from Postel et al. (2019) turns out to be a solid approximation,
albeit used due to the different Herschel instruments (PACS,
SPIRE SSW, SPIRE SLW).

4.3 UV field and accretion

As we modelled the condition of Re 50 N IRS 1 during the
phase of higher activity, it is possible that the UV field and the
accretion rate are lower now. As ProDiMo does not have the
capabilities to model directly the effects of shocks leading to
sufficiently high temperatures in certain areas, especially along
the outflow cavity, we bypass this with the introduction of the
UV field originating from the central source. For reaching
sufficiently high temperatures for the CO transitions with short
wavelengths and the [O i], the respective parameters appear to
be inevitable in the constraints of ProDiMo. It turns out that the
UV field and the disk accretion are both a necessity to create
the short emission lines in the observed combination, and the
accretion of the envelope is the main parameter in our model,
responsible for the overall shape of the SED for this object.

The goal of this grid was to match the mid-IR data. The colour code is the
same as in Fig. 2.

and spectroscopy (grey). The spectrum of the central source is shown in black.

re-brightening of the object. The difference to the ground-based
observations in the (sub-)mm range are explained by our model
by a change of the mass infall rate of the envelope by about one
order of magnitude (see Fig. 2).

Fig. 8 shows that the number density of CO is particularly
high in the envelope close to the outflow cavity (panels with
spatial extent up to 3000 au) and in the disk (panelss with
spatial extent up to 50 au). A very high temperature of the
gas causes a dissociation and depopulation of the CO (see Fig.
9) which consequently leads to a reduced emission from that
region. Too low temperature, however, does not result in the
strong emission lines we see from the Herschel observation, as
the short lines would be then too faint. ProDiMo allows us to
pinpoint down the origin of the different CO lines, which is also
shown in Fig. 8. While the short-wavelength lines like the 72.8
µm emission still originates predominantly from the disk, the
emission at 186 µm already comes mainly from the envelope

effects at the transition region. The second and third line show plots up to 3000 and 10000 au distance from the central object, where the disk does not play a
significant role any more. The dashed lines show the level of the continuum emission at the respective wavelength. The dotted line shows the spatial region
where 15-85 % of the emission in vertical direction originates from. The box shows the spatial region where 15-85 % of the emission in radial direction are
originating from.

5 Discussion

The major difficulty is the distribution of the temperature around
the source, which cannot only be provided by the central source.

The matching of the emission lines shows that a simple enve-
lope + disk model of Re 50 N IRS 1 is not sufficient, but the
system requires a higher complexity of additional heating mech-
anisms. We therefore use the UV field to model the effects of

shocks in jets/outflows to recreate the high-J CO lines, since
ProDiMo does not have the capabilities to model them directly.
Evidence for the presence of a protostellar jet is provided by
the strong [O i] lines in the Herschel spectra and was shown in
other works to be a source for a radiation component (see Dion-
atos & G¨udel 2017 and Dionatos et al. 2020). The inclination
and the opening angle of the outflow cavity of the object play
a main role in the visibility of the gas emission lines, as they
affect the visibility of the accretion disk, where a large fraction
of the emission originates from. The envelope of Re 50 N IRS
1 is likely still dense enough to absorb most of the emission
lines in the line of sight of the disk. Most of the CO emission
originates in the inner disk, at some tens of au, where high J
transition lines in our model originate from. For the intermedi-
ate J transition lines, the envelope close to the outflow cavity
turns out to be the major source, where another high population
of CO is located. The cavity is also where the highest tempera-
tures of the gas occur, which is also where the radiation field
of shocks would be created at. Both, the CO abundance and
temperature distribution is in agreement with former works on
outbursts, like the hydrodynamical simulations from Vorobyov

et al. (2013) which targeted the behaviour of CO.

For some of the spectral features in the SED, e.g. the narrow
absorption of CO2 ice at 15 µm, no matching happened since
ProDiMo currently does not have the capabilities to model
these features.

The high accretion rate of the circumstellar disk of 6 ×10−4
M⊙ yr−1 would cause the accretion disk to dissipate, if it would
stay at this high level for a long time, since the mass infall
rate of the envelope with 1.35 ×10−5 M⊙ yr−1 which feeds
the disk over a long time period is significantly lower. This
means that the object cannot keep the current properties but
the disk accretion is currently in a burst phase which wil last
for a limited amount of time before a lowering of the disk
accretion rate must start. The Spitzer data have been observed
some time before the Herschel data (2010 vs. 2013), so during
the brightening of the object the SED in the near- and mid-IR
could have changed. A check with recent photometry or even a
spectrum would be interesting to confirm this. For a possible
observation, a major part of the SED in the near- and mid-IR
should be traced while the spectral resolution plays a minor
role.

This could also be a reason for the higher optical extinction and
variation they mention, ranging from AV = 50 − 26 mag. Cieza
et al. (2018) derives an inclination of 70◦, a result that is in
disagreement with our model. Based on the Spitzer data and as
we show in Fig. 3, the inclination in our model is not expected
to be above 22.5◦ while 15.3◦ reproduce the observational data
in the best way.

Assuming that the envelope temperature is in the order
of 10-20 K, most models of FUors infer a lower envelope
infall rate (a few 10−6M⊙/yr) if the core was initially close
to a Bonnor-Ebert sphere. The significantly higher infall rate
therefore means that the temperature of the core is much higher,
possibly due to a UV source, or the initial pre-stellar core was
off the equilibrium. The latter could happen if the core was
created by a shock wave.

Postel et al. (2019) include several objects with a similar
shape of the SED as Re 50 N IRS 1, e.g. PP 13 S, V346 Nor,
V883 Ori and HH 381 IRS. However, the emission lines among
these objects appear very different, raising the question of the
reason for this. From our results with ProDiMo for Re 50 N
IRS 1, it appears that these objects, if they show similar line
properties, namely PP 13 S and V346 Nor, must host a similar
distribution of the temperature in the disk and outflow cavity.
Thus, objects like V883 Ori and HH 381 IRS, which show very
faint emission lines, could consist of a colder disk, which would
imply that the activity of these objects is way lower than the
one of Re 50 N IRS 1. Also, inclination could play a role for
these objects, with an envelope shadowing emission lines from
the disk, as proposed by Green et al. (2006). There could be
also a reduced outflow cavity, obscuring the disk. This would
mean that they are in an earlier evolutionary stage if the cavity
did not become large yet, but the envelope shows a similar mass
infall rate as later objects. Objects with a similar SED as Re
50 N IRS 1 would be of interest for further modelling with
ProDiMo, to test these assumptions, and also multi-dish (sub-
)mm observations with high angular resolution would provide
valuable information about the inner regions of the bjects, in
particular the outflow cavity and the disk, which have not yet
been observed, especially if they can provide information about
the temperature.

While the observed features of Re 50 N IRS 1 could be well
reproduced in this work, some line features in other objects
could be an interesting challenge. HH 354 IRS shows a different
shape of the SED, which indicates another evolutionary stage.
Informative here would be to check the connection of the SED
with the presence of the strong oxygen emission at 63 µm and
the relatively weak emission of CO and oxygen at 145.5 µm.

6 Summary

We provide a ProDiMo model of the young stellar object Re
50 N IRS 1 / HBC 494 which matches observational data of

Figure 10: CO rotational diagram for the best model compared to the
observational data obtained with Herschel. The gap around 2000 K is caused
by a non-detection of the lines in the Herschel data.

When calculating the stellar radius based on the values of
the modelled object via Rstar = 0.5 ˙MGMstar/Laccr (assuming
that half of the energy goes into the star and half escapes),
we would end up with a stellar radius of 52 R⊙ during the
outburst, a too large value compared to models. This equation
also assumes that the luminosity is dominated by the accretion
luminosity and is therefore a lower limit. Given the small
impact on the SED, we think that a reduction of the stellar mass
to 0.3 M⊙ is feasible, leading to a reduced radius of 31 R⊙
which appears still high. A larger distance than the used 414 pc
would lead to higher luminosities, and thus, a lower radius. A
10% increase (≈ 450 pc) would lead to 110 L⊙, and a radius of
less than 26 R⊙, which is more of a reasonable value according
to recent numerical simulations of stellar characteristics during
accretion bursts (Elbakyan et al. 2019). Großschedl et al. (2018)
showed that the Orion A cloud is inclined from the plane of sky
and reaches up to 470 pc, depending on the Galactic longitude.
Based on their Figure 3, at l = 211.6◦, YSOs generally are
have distances of 425-450 pc (the range is consistent with their
derived median distance for the Tail of Orion A, L1641, ≈ 430
pc, although they derive an average distance of 409.36 ± 31.9
for the above longitude, using a 1-degree longitude bin, albeit
with a large uncertainty), suggesting that a higher distance for
Re 50 N IRS 1 is possible.

For some parameters, there seem to be strong differences
among other works. Gramajo et al. (2014) listed for the object a
distance of 460 pc and a luminosity of 50 L⊙ while Chiang et al.
(2015) came to a luminosity of 250 L⊙. Also other parameters
in their model, like the accretion rate, differ significantly from
our results. As we mentioned earlier, Chiang et al. (2015)
assume that a dust clearing effect occured, based on near-IR
data. However, we see from mid-IR to sub-mm data that there
must still be a very strong accretion, possibly in combination

object, covering both the SED and emission lines of CO, 13CO
and two [O I] lines. We find a way to recreate the gas lines
of the target by an accreting envelope and a circumstellar disk
with high accretion rate and an additional UV field to heat up
the disk and outflow cavity to form the necessary environmental
conditions. The gas lines appear to have their origin in the disk
and the transition region of the envelope and the outflow cavity,
created by shocks in jets/outflows. The envelope turns out to be
dense enough to absorb most emission in the line of sight to the
disk. The system requires episodic accretion to be consistent
over long time with a high disk accretion rate and a significantly
smaller mass infall rate of the envelope.
