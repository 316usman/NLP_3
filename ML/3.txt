Abstract:  The  software  for  clustering  students  according  to  their  educational  achievements  using  fuzzy  logic  was 
developed in Python using the Google Colab cloud service. In the process of analyzing educational data, the problems 
of Data Mining are solved, since only some characteristics of the educational process are obtained from a large sample 
of  data.  Data  clustering  was  performed  using  the  classic  K-Means  method,  which  is  characterized  by  simplicity  and 
high speed. Cluster analysis was performed in the space of two features using the machine learning library scikit-learn 
(Python).  The  obtained  clusters  are  described  by  fuzzy  triangular  membership  functions,  which  allowed  to  correctly 
determine the  membership of each student to a certain cluster. Creation of fuzzy membership functions is done using 
the  scikit-fuzzy  library.  The  development  of  fuzzy  functions  of  objects  belonging  to  clusters  is  also  useful  for 
educational purposes, as it allows a better understanding of the principles of using fuzzy logic. As a result of processing 
test  educational  data  using  the  developed  software,  correct  results  were  obtained.  It  is  shown  that  the  use  of  fuzzy 
membership functions makes it possible to correctly determine the belonging of students to certain clusters, even if such 
clusters  are  not  clearly  separated.  Due  to  this,  it  is  possible  to  more  accurately  determine  the  recommended  level  of 
difficulty of tasks for each student, depending on his previous evaluations.

1.  Introduction 

At  present,  large  volumes  of  data  are  processed  in  education,  which  are  obtained  at  various  stages  of  the 
educational process [1-4]. For example, the parameters of students and the results of their studies in various subjects are

processed. When analyzing such data, the problems of Data Mining are solved, since only some useful characteristics 
need to be obtained from a large sample of data [5-7]. Manual analysis of educational data is quite time time-consuming 
and requires a high qualification of the performer. Therefore, computer clustering methods are currently widely used for 
the analysis of educational data. 

Clustering methods use unsupervised learning, so no prior training is required [8,9]. Clustering methods are used to 
divide the initial set of large data into parts (clusters). This allows you to structure the data and identify certain useful 
patterns in them. In addition, the analysis of a small cluster is much simpler than the processing of the entire initial set. 
Clustering is usually performed in the space of two parameters. As clustering parameters, for example, intermediate and 
final results of students' studies in certain subjects are used. A number of clustering methods are used. A popular and 
effective clustering method is the K-means. This method allows to divide the initial set of data into several clusters that 
do not overlap, that is, clear clustering is performed. As a result of clustering students according to their grades, each 
cluster  contains  students  with  a  characteristic  combination  of  grades,  for  example,  with  average  grades  for  the  first 
assignment and high grades for the second assignment. 

In an ideal case, the inter-cluster distance is much larger than the intra-cluster distance, so such clusters are clearly 
separated. However, when processing real educational data, there are often no clear boundaries between clusters. The 
problem is that objects on the borders of clusters are difficult to attribute to only one cluster. Such data clusters can be 
considered as fuzzy sets, for which the membership of an object to a certain cluster is described by a fuzzy membership 
function.  Due  to  fuzzy  membership  functions,  it  is  possible  to  correctly  describe  the  membership  of  a  certain  object, 
which is on the border of clusters, to several clusters at the same time. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to increase 
the accuracy of clustering of educational data due to the use of fuzzy logic tools [10]. 

Thus,  the  work  is  relevant  because  the  use  of  fuzzy  membership  functions  allows  to  correctly  determine  the 
membership of students to certain clusters, even if such clusters are not clearly separated. Thanks to this, it is possible to 
more accurately determine the recommended level of difficulty of tasks for each student, depending on his educational 
achievements. 

2.  Related Works 

Clustering methods are effective  for the analysis of  educational data, as they allow dividing a set of objects into 
groups (clusters) according to certain parameters.  A characteristic feature of clusters is that objects in one cluster are 
more similar to each other than objects in different clusters. Cluster analysis of data in order to evaluate and increase the 
efficiency of the educational process was carried out in a number of works [8,9,10,11,12]. 

Currently,  a  number  of  clustering  methods  are  used,  each  of  which  has  certain  advantages,  disadvantages  and 
scope  of  use.  For  example,  the  machine  learning  library  scikit-learn  (in  Python)  contains  more  than  10  clustering 
methods. Source [8] describes the main methods of clustering: 

1. The classic K-Means clustering method is widespread, simple and fast. For these reasons, it is advisable to use 
the K-Means method for clustering educational data. In this method, the number of clusters is set by the user based on 
the  conditions  of  the  problem  or  by  sorting  in  a  certain  range.  The  division  of  objects  into  clusters  is  performed 
iteratively. The obtained clusters do not intersect, that is, one object can belong to only one cluster. For each cluster, the 
coordinates of its center (centroid) are calculated. 

2. The MeanShift method is similar to K-Means, but determines the number of clusters automatically. A common 

field of use of the method is segmentation. 

3. The DBSCAN (Density-Based Application Spatial Clustering  with Noise)  method is based on the assumption 

that clusters are dense regions in the feature space that are separated by less dense regions. 

4. The BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies) method belongs to the hierarchical 
method,  it  is  quite  effective  from  the  point  of  view  of  memory  usage  when  processing  large  data  sets.  The  BIRCH 
method creates a tree-like data structure and calculates the coordinates of the centroids. 

In  work  [12],  clustering  methods  were  used  to  analyze  student  behavioral  patterns.  Clustering  methods  of  5 
categories are considered: partitioning methods, density-based methods, grid-based methods and model-based methods, 
hierarchical methods. It is shown that different clustering methods can give different results when processing the same 
set of data. Hierarchical clustering is considered separately, which consists in building a hierarchy of clusters using two 
methods: agglomerative (based on merging) and divisive (based on splitting data). It is shown that combining the results 
of various clustering  methods, for example, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications  with Noise (DBSCAN) 
and k-means, is effective. 

In  modern  educational  platforms,  clustering  methods  (for  example,  the  K-Means  method)  provide  an  effective 
method  of  evaluating  student  learning  outcomes  [9].  Based  on  the  analysis  of  such  clustering,  recommendations  for 
training are provided both in the case of face-to-face and distance learning. Cluster analysis of intermediate and final 
learning results allows adjusting the level of difficulty of learning tasks. The application of intelligent data analysis to 
educational statistics in general expands the possibilities of network education, increases the effectiveness of teaching 
and learning. In the process of intelligent data analysis, hidden, unknown and potentially useful information is obtained

from a large database. 

In  the  field  of  education,  clustering  is  used  to  identify  student  behavior  patterns  and  take  appropriate  actions  to 
optimize the learning process. Cluster analysis makes it possible to identify various behavioral factors that are strongly 
correlated  with  the  success  of  students'  studies  [10].  In  most  cases,  K-Means,  BIRCH,  and  DBSCAN  algorithms  are 
used  for  clustering  educational  data  [11].  With  their  help,  it  is  possible  to  analyze  and  correct  students'  studies  in 
electronic systems, as well as predict their achievements. 

In order to increase the speed of data processing, parallel clustering methods are used, for example, the DBSCAN 

parallel method [13]. The greatest advantage of the DBSCAN method is robustness to outliers. 

However,  when  clustering  educational  data,  the  obtained  clusters  are  not  always  clearly  separated,  and  the 
parameters of the educational process are often vague values [14]. In this case, the criteria of the education system are 
described as fuzzy sets with certain fuzzy membership functions (for example, triangular). In work [15], an analysis of 
the  success  of  students  in  higher  education  was  implemented  using  fuzzy  logic.  Student  success  in  this  work  is 
described by fuzzy membership functions. 

Fuzzy  clustering  algorithms  (soft  clustering  algorithms),  such  as  Fuzzy  K-Means  and  Fuzzy  C-Means  (FCM) 
algorithms,  are  used  to  process  data  that  do  not  form  clear  clusters  [16].  The  Fuzzy  K-Means  algorithm  is  a  fuzzy 
analogue of the K-Means algorithm. A feature of the  Fuzzy C-Means algorithm is the automatic determination of the 
number of clusters. Fuzzy clustering algorithms allow one element of the set to belong to several clusters (with different 
degrees of belonging) [17]. Fuzzy logic capabilities are widely used to control complex systems [18]. In work [19] the 
use  of  fuzzy  membership  functions  for  image  segments  is  considered.  However,  membership  functions  calculated  by 
fuzzy clustering algorithms do not in all cases correctly describe the membership of a certain object to different clusters, 
taking  into account the requirements of a  specific task. This is caused, in particular, by the complex and asymmetric 
(relative  to  the  center)  form  of  clusters  obtained  during  the  processing  of  educational  data.  Therefore,  to  expand  the 
possibilities  of  analysis,  the  description  of  data  by  means  of  fuzzy  logic  is  used,  with  the  possibility  of  choosing  the 
parameters of fuzzy membership functions. 

Based  on  the  analysis  of  modern  research,  a  conclusion  was  made  about  the  need  to  develop  software  tools  for 
clustering students based on the results of their studies using fuzzy logic. It is advisable to perform clustering using the 
classic  K-Means  method,  which  belongs  to  the  model-based  category,  is  characterized  by  simplicity  and  high  speed. 
The obtained clusters should be described by fuzzy membership functions, which will allow to correctly determine the 
membership of each student to a certain cluster. The development of fuzzy membership functions of objects belonging 
to clusters is also useful for educational purposes,  as it allows a better understanding of the principles of using fuzzy 
logic.  Software  tools  for  processing  educational  data  should  be  developed  in  Python  using  specialized  libraries  and 
modules (for example, scikit-learn library, module sklearn. cluster). 

3.  Methodology 

3.1.  Basics of educational data clustering 

The educational process and its participants will be described using D parameters y1, y2,..., yD, each of which takes 
Q  values.  For  example,  the  parameters  y1  and  y2  could  represent  the  Q  scores  of  students  in  Math  and  English, 
respectively. For the sake of simplification, the cluster analysis will be carried out in the space of two features x and y, 
that is, we will simultaneously carry out clustering according to 2 parameters (for example, for x = y1, y = y2) [8]. Thus, 
if perform clustering according to x and y parameters, then each object of educational data can be represented as a point 
on a plane with coordinates (x, y). 

Let us consider in more detail the clustering according to the parameters x(i) and y(i), where i = 1,..., Q. To find the 

distance between objects with numbers i and j, will use the Euclidean distance ρ(i, j): 

𝜌(𝑖, 𝑗) = √(𝑥(𝑖) − 𝑥(𝑗))2 + (𝑦(𝑖) − 𝑦(𝑗))2.                                                       (1) 

Intra-cluster  distance  (2)  and  inter-cluster  distance  (3)  are  used  to  assess  the  quality  of  clustering.  The  average 

intra-cluster distance F0 should be as small as possible:

In practice, the ratio of a pair of functionals is calculated to take into account both inter-cluster F1 and intra-cluster 

distances F0:

library [20]. 

3.2.  Basics of using fuzzy membership functions 

Fuzzy triangular membership functions were used to determine the belonging of a certain object to clusters [15,16]. 
The fuzzy membership function µx(k, dx) describes the membership to the cluster with number  k of the object whose 
distance to the center of cluster k along the x coordinate is equal to dx (the object number is denoted by iv). Similarly, 
the fuzzy membership function µy(k, dy) describes the membership to the cluster with the number k of the object whose 
distance  to  the  center  of  the  cluster  k  along  the  y  coordinate  is  equal  to  dy.  The  fuzzy  membership  function  µρ(k,  ρ) 
describes  the  membership  to  the  cluster  with  the  number  k  of  the  object  for  which  the  Euclidean  distance  (1)  to  the 
center of the cluster k is equal to ρ. 

For  each  cluster  with  number  k,  its  radius  Rc  is  calculated  as  the  Euclidean  distance  (1)  from  the  center  of  the 
cluster in the space of two features x and y. Forms of clusters for real educational data differ in significant asymmetry, 
therefore, in addition to the radius Rc, the following radii were calculated for each cluster: 

•  RcxL – radius for the left part of the cluster according to the x coordinate. 
•  RcxR – radius for the right part of the cluster according to the x coordinate. 
•  RcyDn – radius for the lower part of the cluster according to the y coordinate. 
•  RcyUp – the radius for the upper part of the cluster according to the y coordinate. 

The calculation of fuzzy membership functions of objects belonging to clusters is performed as follows. Based on 
the Euclidean distance ρ of the object to the center of the cluster k by coordinates (x, y), the degree of belonging of the 
object to the cluster is calculated as the value of the fuzzy membership function µρ(k, ρ) according to the formula: 

𝜇𝜌(𝑘, 𝜌) = 1 −

𝜌
𝑅𝑐⋅𝑘𝑅

,                                                                            (5) 

where Rc is the radius of cluster k, calculated as the Euclidean distance (1); 

kR – radius change factor (for example, kR = 1.5). 
By the radius change factor  kR, it is possible to adjust the overlap of clusters depending on the conditions of the 
task (the stronger the relationship of the data, the more overlapping the clusters and the larger  kR value). That is, if the 
distance ρ of the object from the center of cluster k is equal to 0, then µρ(k, ρ) = 1; if the distance ρ is equal to or greater 
than Rc ∙ kR, then µρ(k, ρ) = 0 (the object does not belong to the cluster). 

Similarly to the function µρ(k, ρ), the following fuzzy membership functions are calculated: 

•  µx(k, dx) is a fuzzy membership function of object belonging to cluster k, whose distance to the center of the 

cluster by coordinate x is equal to dx. 

•  µy(k, dy) is a fuzzy membership function of object belonging to cluster k, the distance of which to the center of 

the cluster according to the y coordinate is equal to dy. 

The  calculation  of  µx(k,  dx)  for  the  left  part  of  the  cluster  (relative  to  the  center)  is  performed  according  to  the 

formula: 

𝜇𝑥(𝑘, 𝑑𝑥) = 1 −

𝑑𝑥
𝑅𝑐𝑥𝐿⋅𝑘𝑅

,                                                                         (6) 

and for the right part of the cluster is performed according to a similar formula 

The calculation of µy(k, dy) for the lower part of the cluster (relative to the center) is performed according to the 

formula: 

𝜇𝑥(𝑘, 𝑑𝑥) = 1 −

𝑑𝑥
𝑅𝑐𝑥𝑅⋅𝑘𝑅

.                                                                       (7)

and for the upper part of the cluster according to a similar formula 

𝜇𝑦(𝑘, 𝑑𝑦) = 1 −

.                                                                        (9) 

The degree of belonging of an object to cluster k by all coordinates µxy(k, dx, dy) is calculated using the values of 

two membership functions µx(k, dx) and µy(k, dy) according to the formula: 

𝜇𝑥𝑦(𝑘, 𝑑𝑥, 𝑑𝑦) =

2
√(𝜇𝑥(𝑘,𝑑𝑥))2+(𝜇𝑦(𝑘,𝑑𝑦))

.                                                       (10) 

By  correction  of  the  coefficient  kR  in  formulas  (5-9),  it  is  possible  to  clarify  the  values  of  fuzzy  membership 
functions, to regulate more or less overlap of clusters. Thus, the proposed methodology allows supplementing clustering 
methods with fuzzy logic, which provides more accurate cluster analysis for educational data. 

4.  Software Implementation 

Software  tools  for  the  clustering  of  educational  data  and  their  analysis  using  fuzzy  logic  were  developed  in  the 
Python  language  using  the  Google  Colab  cloud  service  (in  the  Jupyter  Notebook)  [21].  Data  clustering  consists  in 
dividing Q objects of the educational process into Qk clusters in the space of two features (based on parameters x and y). 
According  to  the  flowchart  of  the  algorithm  (Fig.  1),  initial  educational  data  (for  example,  student  grades  in 
various  subjects)  are  first  read.  Among  all  the  parameters  of  the  educational  process,  two  are  chosen:  x  and  y.  If  the 
range  of  values  of  parameter  x  is  significantly  larger  (more  than  an  order  of  magnitude)  than  the  range  of  values  of 
parameter y, then one of the parameters is scaled so that the ranges of values of different parameters differ by no more 
than an order of magnitude (such scaling is required to take into account when clustering the values of both parameters). 
Next, the user sets the quantity of clusters Qk. 

Fig. 1. Flowchart of the algorithm of cluster analysis of educational data 

Data clustering (recorded in arrays  x(i) and y(i), where i =  1,..., Q) is performed by the K-Means method by the 
KMeans() function of the sklearn.cluster library using the Euclidean distance (1) between objects (in the space of their 
parameters). In the process of clustering, relation (4) is maximized. The number of clusters Qk is passed as a parameter 
to  the  KMeans()  function.  As  a  result  of  clustering,  the  coordinates  of  the  centers  of  the  clusters  (as  the  centers  of 
gravity) are calculated: the coordinates of the centers of the clusters according to the first parameter are written into the 
array Cs(k, 0), and the coordinates of the centers of the clusters according to the second parameter are written into the 
array Cs(k, 1), where the cluster number k = 1,..., Qk. The cluster number for each object is recorded in the array  Nc(i), 
where i = 1,..., Q. The number of objects Cq in the clusters is also calculated. 

After clustering, the cluster radii Rc, RcxL, RcxR, RcyDn and RcyUp are calculated. For each cluster k, by formulas (5-10) 
calculated fuzzy membership functions µρ(k, ρ), µx(k, dx), µy(k, dy) and µxy(k, dx, dy). Calculation of triangular fuzzy 
membership  functions  is  performed  by  the  trimf()  function  of  the  scikit-fuzzy  library.  Fuzzy  membership  functions 
quantitatively describe the membership of an object to a certain cluster (the smaller the distance from the object to the

center  of  the  cluster,  the  greater  the  value  of  the  corresponding  membership  functions).  On  the  basis  of  fuzzy 
membership  functions,  the  degree  of  membership  of  objects  specified  by  the  user  to  each  cluster  is  determined.  The 
resulting clusters and fuzzy membership functions are visualized. 

If  the  selected  number  of  clusters  Qk  does  not  provide  the  required  accuracy  of  clustering  (taking  into  account 
criterion (4)), then clustering is performed for the changed value of  Qk. The obtained results of the cluster analysis are 
stored in files.

5.1.  Initial data 

Verification  of  the  developed  software  was  performed  using  test  educational  data  (Table  1)  [22].  The  learning 
results  of  each  student  with  number  i  are  described  by  a  number  of  parameters:  "math  score",  "reading  score"  and 
"writing score".

The cluster analysis was carried out on the basis of the numerical fields named "math score", "reading score" and 
"writing  score",  the  values  of  which  are  in  the  range  from  0  to 100. The  value  of  the  field "math  score"  is read  as  a 
parameter y1, the value of the field "reading score" are read as the y2 parameter, and the "writing score" field values are 
read as the y3 parameter. Each of the parameters y1, y2 and y3 takes Q values (Q = 1000). 

5.2.  Results of cluster analysis 

A cluster analysis was carried out in the space of two features with the names "math score" and "reading score", 
that is, the values of the parameters x = y1 and y = y2. Using the K-Means method, the following results of initial data 
clustering were obtained (Fig. 2).

Clustering Students According to their Academic Achievement Using Fuzzy Logic 

Fig. 2. An example of clustering of test data (Table 1) according to the parameters "math score", "reading score"; Rc is the radius of the cluster 

Each number of the cluster with the number k corresponds to a set that describes the results of student learning: 

• 
• 
• 
• 

k = 1 – the set of "low math and reading scores". 
k = 2 – the set of "below average math and reading scores". 
k = 3 – the set of "average math and reading scores". 
k = 4 – the set of "high math and reading scores".  

Therefore, on the basis of the obtained clusters and their corresponding sets, it is possible to evaluate the results of 

student learning. 

The forms of clusters for real educational data differ in significant asymmetry (Fig. 2), therefore, in addition to the 
radius Rc, the radii RcxL, RcxR, RcyDn and RcyUp were also calculated for each cluster. The introduction of such 4 radii (RcxL, 
RcxR, RcyDn, RcyUp) makes it possible to more accurately localize the areas of the clusters (Fig. 3).

arcs with radii RcxL, RcxR, RcyDn, RcyUp (in each quadrant of the coordinate system) 

The distance from the center of the cluster to an arbitrary object (any cluster) along the x coordinate is denoted by 
dx (Fig. 3). Similarly, the distance from the center of the cluster to an arbitrary object along the y coordinate is denoted 
by dy, and the Euclidean distance from the center of the cluster to an arbitrary object is denoted by ρ. 

For the user-selected student with number iv, the distance dx0 to the center of cluster k is calculated by coordinate x, 
and based on the distance dx0, the degree of belonging of this student to cluster k is calculated as the value µx(k, dx0) 
(Fig. 4). For the selected student with number iv, the distance dy0 to the center of cluster k along the y coordinate is also 
calculated, and based on the distance dy0, the degree of belonging of this student to cluster k is calculated as the value 
µy(k, dy0) (Fig. 5). Similarly, for the selected student with number  iv, the Euclidean distance ρ0 from the center of the 
cluster is calculated, and based on the distance ρ0, the degree of belonging of this student to cluster k is calculated as the 
value µρ(k, ρ0) (Fig. 6).

Clustering Students According to their Academic Achievement Using Fuzzy Logic 

Fig.  6.  Fuzzy  membership  functions  µρ(k,  ρ)  of  students  to  clusters  with  numbers  k  =1,  2,  3,  4  according  to  "math  score"  and  "reading  score" 
parameters; the values of the distance ρ0 for the student with number iv =12 are indicated by a vertical line (Fig. 3) 

Based  on  the  fuzzy  membership  functions  µx(k,  dx0)  (Fig.  4)  and  µy(k,  dy0)  (Fig.  5),  the  value  of  the  degree  of 
belonging of the student with number iv (selected by the user) to clusters with numbers k (Fig. 7) was calculated as the 
values of µxR(k) and µyR(k), respectively. On the basis of fuzzy membership functions µρ(k, ρ0) (Fig. 6), the value of the 
degree  of  belonging  of  the  student  with  number  iv  to  clusters  with  numbers  k  (Fig.  8) was  calculated  as  the  value  of 
µρR(k). Based on the calculated values of µxR(k) and µyR(k) by formula (10), the value of the degree of belonging of the 
student  with  number  iv  to  clusters  with  numbers  k  was  calculated  as  the  value  of  µxyR(k).  At  the  same  time,  µxyR(k) 
values  more  correctly  show  the  belonging  of  objects  to  clusters  (compared  to  µρR(k)),  since  the  asymmetric  shape  of 
clusters, which is described by the radii RcxL, RcxR, RcyDn, RcyUp, is taken into account when calculating µxyR(k). 

Therefore,  based  on  the  calculated  µxyR(k)  values,  it  is  possible  to  fairly  accurately  assess  the  student's  learning 
outcomes. For example, the student with number iv (Fig. 8) mostly belongs to cluster #3 (µxyR(3) = 0.83) – the fuzzy set 
"average math and reading scores", and to a lesser extent belongs to cluster #2 (µxyR(2) = 0.63) is a fuzzy set of "below 
average math and reading scores". Such information is also useful for determining the level of difficulty of educational 
tasks (each number of the cluster corresponds to the corresponding level of difficulty of the task). For example, for the 
considered  student  with  number  iv,  it  is  advisable  to  offer  tasks  with  difficulty  level  3  and  additionally  tasks  with 
difficulty level 2.

membership functions µx(k, dx0) (Fig. 4) and µy(k, dy0) (Fig. 5)

membership functions µρ(k, ρ0) (Fig. 6) and µxy(k, dx0, dy0) (10) 

For  all  clusters,  the  coordinates  of  the  centers  of  clusters  with  numbers  k  were  also  calculated  based  on  the 

characteristics of "math score", "reading score" and the number of students Cq in the clusters (Fig. 9). 

Fig. 9. Coordinates of the centers of clusters with numbers k according to the characteristics "math score", "reading score" and the number of students 
Cq in the clusters (Fig. 3) 

The obtained coordinates of the cluster centers describe the average learning results of the students of each cluster. 
Analysis of the number of Cq students in clusters allows to assess the level of difficulty of tasks. In the considered case, 
the distribution of the number of Cq students in clusters is close to normal, so the difficulty level of the tasks is chosen 
correctly. 

6.  Conclusions 

As a result of the work, the following results were obtained. 
Software  tools  for  clustering  students  according  to  their  educational  achievements  using  fuzzy  logic  have  been 
developed.  The  program  was  implemented  in  Python  using  the  Google  Colab  cloud  service  using  the  scikit-learn 
machine  learning  library  and  the  scikit-fuzzy  library  for  working  with  fuzzy  logic.  Clustering  was  performed  in  the 
space of two features using the classic K-Means method, which is characterized by simplicity and high speed. 

The novelty of the work is the description of clusters by their own fuzzy triangular membership functions µρ, µx, µy 
and  µxy  (5-10),  which  allowed  to  correctly  determine  the  membership  of  each  student  in  a  certain  cluster.  The 
development of fuzzy membership functions of objects belonging to clusters is also done for educational purposes, as it 
allows  a  better  understanding  of  the  principles  of  using  fuzzy  logic.  It  is  shown  that  the  description  of  the  shape  of 
clusters using the radii RcxL, RcxR, RcyDn, RcyUp, calculated for various parameters, makes it possible to more accurately 
calculate the value of the fuzzy membership function of the object belonging to the cluster.  

By the developed software, the test educational data was processed. As a result, students were divided into clusters, 
each  of  which  corresponds  to  a  group  of  students  with  a  characteristic  combination  of  grades  in  different  subjects. 
Testing of the developed software showed that the use of fuzzy logic ensures the correct determination of the belonging 
degree of students to certain groups (clusters) even in the absence of clear boundaries between clusters. Due to this, the 
software allows you to individually determine the recommended level of difficulty of tasks for each student, depending 
on his previous learning results.
