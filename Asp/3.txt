One of the unique aspects of Earth is that it has a fractionally large Moon, which is thought to
have formed from a Moon-forming disk generated by a giant impact. The Moon stabilizes the
Earth’s spin axis at least by several degrees and contributes to Earth’s stable climate. Given
that impacts are common during planet formation, exomoons, which are moons around
planets in extrasolar systems, should be common as well, but no exomoon has been con-
ﬁrmed. Here we propose that an initially vapor-rich moon-forming disk is not capable of
forming a moon that is large with respect to the size of the planet because growing moonlets,
which are building blocks of a moon, experience strong gas drag and quickly fall toward the
planet. Our impact simulations show that terrestrial and icy planets that are larger
than ~1.3−1.6R⊕ produce entirely vapor disks, which fail to form a fractionally large moon.
This indicates that (1) our model supports the Moon-formation models that produce vapor-
poor disks and (2) rocky and icy exoplanets whose radii are smaller than ~1.6R⊕ are ideal
candidates for hosting fractionally large exomoons.

Earth is the only known life-hosting planet and has a number

of features unique to our solar system, including active plate
tectonics, a strong magnetic ﬁeld, and a large moon with
respect to the size of Earth. The presence of the Moon controls
the length of the day and ocean tides, which affects the terrestrial
biological cycles. The Moon also stabilizes the Earth’s spin axis by
at least several degrees1–3. Thus, at least for Earth, the Moon also
contributes to Earth’s stable climate and potentially offers an ideal
environment for life to develop and evolve. It should be noted,
however, that the stability depends on several factors, such as the
initial obliquity of the planet4,5.

The origin of the Moon and conditions to host a massive
satellite have been under active debate. According to the cano-
nical hypothesis of the lunar origin, the Moon formed from a
partially vaporized disk generated by a collision between Earth
and a Mars-sized impactor approximately 4.5 billion years ago6–8.
This giant impact hypothesis was originally thought to be able to
explain the geochemical observation that the Earth and Moon
isotopic ratios9, assuming that a large
have nearly identical
impact can homogenize the two bodies. However, numerical
simulations ﬁnd that the disk is primarily made of the impactor
materials and it is challenging to mix the two reservoirs10. This
requires the impactor (“Theia”) to have isotopic ratios nearly
identical to Earth by chance11,12 or homogenization during the
disk stage13.

Alternatively, the Moon could have formed by a more energetic
impact that would have homogenized the system more easily.
Proposed energetic impacts include a collision between two half-
Earth-sized objects14, and other high-energy and high-angular
momentum cases15,16. One of the potential problems of the
energetic models is that the ﬁnal angular momentum of the
system is two to three times higher than the current value, which
may not be easily removed from the system17. Moreover, these
impacts would have homogenized the Earth’s mantle, which
may not be consistent with geochemical observations18. Another
option is that the Moon could have formed by multiple impacts19.
Small- and high-speed impactors can strip and launch Earth’s
mantle materials into orbit, but if some of the impactors are large
or slow, the disk and therefore the Moon would still hold isotopic
signatures originating from the impactors.

These impacts generate the Moon-forming disks with various
vapor mass fractions (VMF). In general, energetic impacts lead to
higher VMF of the disk. The VMF for the canonical model is
0.1–0.320, and those for half-Earths as well as high velocity and
high-angular momentum cases are 0.7–1.020, and those for the
multiple moon model are 0.1–0.519. As the disk cools, VMF
decreases. It is conventionally thought that moonlets (or lunate-
simals) accrete from the liquid portion of the disk and moonlets
accrete into the Moon over time. We revisit this process later in
this work.

it

is expected that

Given that planetary collisions are common in the young solar
system and may have already been detected in extrasolar systems
(e.g., refs. 21–24),
impact-induced moons
(exomoons) are common (e.g., ref. 25). Unfortunately, we cur-
rently have a very limited understanding of the origin of exo-
moons due to a lack of conﬁrmed exomoons. While several
detection methods have been proposed for exomoons, including
direct imaging26 and microlensing27, the Hunt for Exomoons
with Kepler (HEK) (e.g., ref. 28) is leading the effort for exomoon
detection, analyzing the Kepler data for an indication of any
transit timing and transit duration variations (TTV and TDV) of
exoplanets due to exomoons. Despite the extensive search (57
exoplanets were searched during HEK I-V28) and a follow-up
study with the Hubble Space Telescope29, no exomoon has been
conﬁrmed to date30–32. Detecting an exomoon is very challen-
ging, and the lifetime of moons around close-in planets, such as

most of the Kepler planets, could be short due to the strong tide
from the stars33. Moreover, close-in planets have small Hill radii,
which is the distance where the gravity of the planet is dominant,
and some moons that migrate outward can be lost due to orbital
instability33. In the canonical “graze and merge” moon-forming
scenario8, the return of the projectile occurs only if the projectile
loops inside the 1/3 of the Hill radius34. Hence closer-in planets
(with smaller Hill radii) would be less likely to experience a
similar graze-and-merge impact. Nonetheless, planetary impacts
that would lead to moon formation should be common in the late
stages of planetary accretion, and the lack of a conﬁrmed exo-
moon detection has not been fully explained.

Here, we explore the possibility of not all the planets can form
impact-induced moons, which can be fractionally large with respect
to their host planets. We constrain the condition to form impact-
induced moons in order to (1) constrain the lunar origin, and (2)
explain the lack of conﬁrmed exomoons to date. We conduct
impact simulations with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) method, which describes ﬂuid as a collection of particles20,35,
to characterize moon-forming disks and moon accretion process.
We consider two endmembers of planetary compositions: a rocky
planet consisting of 70 wt% of forsterite mantle and 30 wt% iron
core and an icy planet consisting of 70 wt% water ice and 30 wt%
forsterite core. Gas giants and mini-Neptunes are not the primary
focus of this study, but we discuss implications for these planets
later. Our simulations show that a moon-forming disk with a high
vapor mass fraction (VMF) is not capable of forming a moon that
is large with respect to the size of the planet because growing
moonlets of 100 m–100 km in size in the disk experience strong gas
drag from vapor, lose their angular momentum and fall onto the
planet on a short timescale, failing to grow further. This does not
occur in a vapor-poor disk (i.e., small VMF) because the gas drag
effect is much weaker. An initially vapor-rich disk can start forming
stable moonlets once it cools and the VMF is small enough, but by
the time a signiﬁcant portion of the disk mass is lost, failing to form
a fractionally large moon. Consequently, our study supports the
moon-formation models that produce initially small VMF, such as
the canonical model. Moreover, we ﬁnd that rocky planets larger
than 6 M⊕ (~1.6 R⊕, where R⊕ is the Earth radii), where M⊕ is the
Earth mass, and icy planets larger than 1 M⊕ (~1.3 R⊕) produce
completely vapor disks, and therefore these planets are not capable
of forming fractionally large impact-induced moons. For this rea-
son, we propose that future exomoon observations should focus on
impact-induced
exoplanets
exomoons.

Results
Effect of vapor on growing moonlets. If a moon-forming disk
started from a completely vapor state (i.e., VMF = 1.0), liquid
droplets would start forming as the disk cools. These liquid
droplets fall toward the midplane on a short timescale36. They
would experience strong gas drag from the vapor because droplets
orbit around the planet with the Keplerian velocity vK, whereas
vapor moves slower due to the radial pressure support. This radial

considered for small droplets, but not for growing moonlets16,
which are building blocks of a moon.

In fact, this was a major challenge for planet formation in the
protoplanetary disk. The very same mechanism would have
removed 1 m-sized planetesimals, which are building blocks of
planets, at 1 AU on the timescale of 80 years37,38, which is a much
shorter timescale than the planet formation timescale (a few to
tens of millions of years). This is the so-called “meter-barrier
problem” and was an outstanding problem in planetary science
for decades.

While this is the ﬁrst time to investigate the effect of gas drag in
a moon-forming disk in detail, previous work also points out
another issue of a vapor-rich disk. The previous work39 suggests
that an initially vapor-rich moon-forming disk may not be
dynamically stable due to shocks caused by density gradients in
the disk and loses a signiﬁcant portion of its mass in a short time,
concluding that a vapor-rich moon-forming disk is not capable of
forming a large moon.

SPH simulations. We conduct SPH simulations to quantify VMF
as well as the pressure graduate parameter η to characterize the
strength of the gas drag. In the case of rocky planets, including
Earth, a high VMF of a moon-forming disk means that the disk is
primarily made of silicate vapor and a small amount of liquid
(magma). For an icy planet, a high VMF can mean a steam disk
potentially with embedded silicate droplets. The parameters for
SPH simulations are the total (target and impactor) mass MT
(M⊕ ≤ MT
≤ 1 M⊕ for
≤ 6 M⊕ for rocky planets and 0.1 M⊕ ≤ MT
icy planets, where M⊕ is the Earth mass), the impactor-to-total-
mass ratio γ (0.13 ≤ γ ≤ 0.45), impact velocity vimp, and impact
angle θ. In this work, we use the ﬁxed impact angle (θ = 48.6∘)
= vesc), where vesc is the mutual
and the impact velocity (vimp
escape velocity. The impact angle and velocity are similar to those
for the canonical moon-forming impact models8,10. The reason
why we explore different mass ranges for the rocky and icy pla-
nets is that the required mass for complete vaporization is dif-
ferent between them, as we discuss in detail below.

Figure 1 shows snapshots of giant impacts with SPH. The top two
rows represent an impact between rocky planets and the bottom two
rows represent an impact between icy planets. The red-yellow and
blue-sky-blue colors represent mantle entropy. Gray (iron) and
orange (silicate) represent the core materials. In both simulations, the
same input parameters are used (MT = 1 M⊕, γ = 0.13, θ = 48.5∘,
= vesc). The icy planets are larger than rocky planets because ice
vimp
is much less dense than silicate. The overall dynamics during an
impact are remarkably similar between the two systems (Fig. 1). In
contrast, thermodynamics during the impacts differ signiﬁcantly. The
overall disk vapor mass fraction is approximately 0.3 (i.e., 70 wt% of
the mass is in the liquid phase) for the rocky planet case, whereas it is
1.0 for the icy planet case. This is primarily because the latent heat of
water (~2.3 × 106 J kg−1) is much smaller than the latent heat of
silicate (~1.2 × 107 J kg−1 40).

The SPH output is summarized in Table 1. Figure 2 shows the
disk mass MD and disk angular momentum LD as a function of the
total mass MT for rocky and icy planets. The colors represent γ,
and the dashed lines represent analytical estimates of the disk
mass25. Generally, the disk mass agrees with the analytical model,
especially at small γ. There is a slight upward trend as a function of
the total mass in the disk mass and angular momentum at γ ≥ 0.30.
This may be because the larger extent of tidal deformation of the
colliding bodies at the time of the impact with larger MT, which
may make the impact angle slightly shallower and generate a larger
disk mass and a larger angular momentum. However, the deviation
relatively small and more
from the analytical
solution is
simulations with larger MT are needed to conﬁrm this trend.

Figure 3 shows the VMF of a moon-forming disk as a function
of γ and MT. The panels (a) and (b) represent rocky and icy
planetary impacts. The vapor mass fraction is over 0.96 at the
planetary mass ≥6 M⊕ for rocky bodies and ≥1 M⊕ for icy
planets. The larger MT is, the higher VMF is in general. This is
because the kinetic energy involved in such an impact generally
increases as the planetary mass increases (see “Methods”).
Moreover, a fractionally larger impactor (i.e., larger γ) contributes
to higher impact-induced heating and higher VMF as well. An icy
planet produces a disk with a higher VMF than a rocky planet
with the same mass, as discussed above.

The disk structures at the midplane formed by the rocky and
icy planet collisions are shown in Fig. 4 (Run ID6, MT = 5 M⊕,
= 1 M⊕, γ = 0.13), respec-
γ = 0.13) and Fig. 5 (Run ID20, MT
tively. The dotted line in panel (a) represents the surface density
directly obtained from the SPH simulation. We ﬁnd that this
initial disk structure is unstable because it does not meet the
Rayleigh criterion where the disk angular momentum Lz needs to
monotonically increase in the radial direction (dLz/dr > 0, where
r is the radial distance from the planet)20,41. Thus, the disk would
dynamically adjust itself within a few days. Two potential disk
surface density structures shown in the solid lines satisfy this
condition while conserving the disk angular momentum and
mass. The skye-blue line represents an exponential model and the
green line represents a model that is a polynomial model (see
“Methods”). The disk temperature (panel b), vapor mass fraction
(panel c) and the pressure gradient parameter η (panel d) are
shown as a function of r/R⊕, where R⊕ is the Earth radius. The
temperature, vapor mass fraction, and η are calculated assuming
that the disk is in the hydrostatic equilibrium20. The pressure
parameter η in the disk is typically ~0.02–0.06 for rock and icy
moon-forming disks, which is ~10 times higher than the typical
values in the protoplanetary disk42.

Radial fall of moonlets. Assuming that η ~ 0.04, the radial fall
timescale for this disk is ~1 day for a 2-km-sized body for a
silicate vapor disk and ~1 day for a 1.3 km for a water vapor disk
(see Methods). This is comparable to the vertical fall timescale of
particles (~a few days36) and much shorter than the accretion
timescale of solid and liquid materials (~1−10s years43). The
typical lifetime for the moon-forming disk is estimated to be ~100
years44, and therefore the radial fall timescale is extremely short
for a few km-sized moonlets. This process can prevent moonlets
from growing larger than km in size, which we call here the “km-
barrier problem” for moon-forming disks. One of the potential
differences between the meter-barrier and km-barrier problems is
that mutual gravity can facilitate the growth of the moonlets in
the latter scenario, but this effect is likely minor and would not
solve the radial fall issue.

An initially 100 wt% vapor disk cannot form a moon that is
large with respect to the size of the planet due to the rapid infall
timescale, according to our arguments above. We, therefore,
propose that the moon-forming disk needs to be initially vapor-
supporting the canonical moon-formation hypothesis
poor,
whose vapor mass fraction is small (0.1–0.3). Moreover, we can
constrain the large moon-forming region as shown in Fig. 6;
rocky planets larger than 6 M⊕ and icy planets larger than 1 M⊕
may not form a large satellite because their VMFs are 1.0. Here, a
“large” moon is deﬁned as a satellite whose mass is approximately
a few to 10 wt% of the planetary mass. This is consistent with the
Earth–Moon (VMF ~0.1–0.320), and Pluto–Charon (icy planets,
VMF ~ 0–0.0845), given that
these moon-forming impacts
produce small VMFs. The radii of a 6 M⊕ rocky planet and a
1 M⊕ icy planet are ~1.3–1.6 R⊕46,47. We also predict
that
gaseous mini-Neptunes may also have trouble producing large

moons because of their large masses as well as potentially more
vapor-rich disks if the H/He gas becomes part of the disk48.

Discussion
It should be noted that our model does not exclude forming small
moons around large planets. As the disk cools and the VMF
decreases, the gas drag effect weakens and moonlets start to form.
However, during the cooling process, the vapor-rich disk would
viscously expand and a signiﬁcant portion of the disk would be
lost to the planet (see “Methods” for detailed discussion). This
can be an explanation for fractionally small moons of Uranus
(1.02 × 10−4 Mp)49, which could have formed by a large
impact48–50.

A large impact is not the only way to form a moon. A satellite
can also form within a circumplanetary disk. The Galilean
satellites and Titan are thought to have formed from dust in such
circumplanetary disks. These disks typically have smaller dust-to-
gas ratios (~10−2–10−4 (see ref. 51)). The typical satellite total
mass formed in a circumplanetary disk is estimated to be
10−4 Mp
51 due to the two competing processes: supply of dust
materials to the disk and satellite loss due to their radial fall
caused by the gas. This total mass estimate is also consistent with
the newly observed exomoon disk mass (~10−4 Mp)52. A moon
can form by gravitational capture. It is unclear if there is a
maximum satellite size in the case of gravitational capture, but at
least in the solar system, gravitationally captured moons have
fractionally small masses (e.g., Triton, 2.46 × 10−4 Mp
53). A

signiﬁcant fraction of the orbital kinetic energy of a heliocentric
body needs to be dissipated during capture, which requires cer-
tain conditions53. In contrast, impacts, especially at relatively low
velocity, can naturally produce fractionally large moons (the
Pluto–Charon system has 0.118 Mp). Under speciﬁc conditions, a
nearly intact impactor can also be captured as a moon45,54, but

this requires very grazing incidence and very low relative velocity
and is thus likely less frequent than moons formed in impact-
induced disks, given that formation of an impact-induced disk is
common55.

There are several aspects that need to be considered further.
The presence of the Roche radius near the moon-forming region

difﬁcult to determine. For this reason, we assume that VMF = 1 is
the upper limit to form an impact-induced large moon.

Here, we consider collisions between planets that have the
same compositions, but a collision between an icy and rock
planets is possible. This may make it possible for a large icy planet
(≥1 M⊕) to have a large rocky satellite if the disk is primarily
made of the rocky impactor. Nevertheless, such impacts are likely
less common unless there are extensive radial mixing events that
lead to a large fraction of planetary objects crossing the ice line
(e.g., Nice model and grand tack scenario58,59).

Our model predicts that the moon-forming disk needs to be
initially liquid or solid rich, supporting the canonical moon-
forming impact model8. Moreover, this work will help narrow
down planetary candidates that may host exomoons; we predict
that planets whose radii are smaller than ~1.6R⊕ would be good
candidates to host fractionally large exomoons (≤6 M⊕ for rocky
planets and ≤1 M⊕ for icy planets). These relatively small exo-
planets are understudied (only four out of 57 exoplanets surveyed
by the HEK project are under this radius limit), which can
potentially explain the lack of exomoon detection to date. Super-
Earths are likely better candidates than mini-Neptunes to host
exomoons due to their generally lower masses and potentially
lower H/He gas contribution to the disk. This narrower para-
meter space may help constrain exomoon search in data from
various telescopes, including Kepler, the Hubble space telescope,
CHaraterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS)60, and the James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

Fig. 3 The vapor mass fraction of the disk as a function of the impactor-
to-total mass ratio and the total mass normalized by the Earth mass. The
panels (a) and (b) represent rocky and icy planet cases, respectively. Brown
colors represent higher vapor mass fractions, whereas blue colors represent
lower values.

makes the accretion process complex. Moonlets that enter inside
the Roche radius become small fragments due to the planetary
tide and they become well coupled with vapor. The evolution of
the fragments may be similar to the evolution of the vapor disk
(see “Methods”), but more detailed disk modeling is necessary to
assess the effect of the Roche radius. In addition, if moonlets can
skip this dangerous km size problem by forming a large moonlet
very quickly, even a vapor-rich disk can potentially form a large
moon. A promising mechanism is so-called streaming instability,
which is a clump-formation mechanism due to the spontaneous
concentration of particles followed by gravitational collapse. This
mechanism was originally proposed to solve the planet formation
problem in the protoplanetary disk56. Whether
the same
mechanism works for a moon-forming disk will be considered in
our future study57.

We only explore limited parameter space (e.g., impactor size
and its velocity), but of course other parameters are possible.
Nevertheless, the parameters chosen here tend to produce a disk
that is massive enough to form a large satellite and that is less
shock-heated than other scenarios (especially when γ = 0.13).
Moreover, it is likely that high VMF cases (e.g., ≥0.8) are enough
to inhibit the accretion of large moons, but the threshold VMF is

Fig. 4 Disk structure formed by an impact between rocky planets
(MT = 5M⊕, γ = 0.13, θ = 48. 5∘, vimp = vesc, and Run ID6). All of these
models have the same angular momenta and disk masses. The panels show (a)
the surface density, (b) temperature, (c) vapor mass fraction, and (d) pressure
gradient parameter η as a function of the radial distance from the planet
r normalized by the Earth radius R⊕. The dotted line represents the direct
outcome from the SPH simulation. The sky-blue line represents an exponential
model and the green line represents a polynomial disk model. The planetary
radius is 1.74 R⊕.

Disk evolution. Here, we describe a simple model that tracks the time evolution of
a completely vapor disk. The disk would viscously spread while conserving the
angular momentum. The analytical solution of the surface density of the disk is
described as49

0 is the initial surface density at r = R, where r is the orbital distance and R is the
planetary radius. rd0 is the typical disk size, which we deﬁne 3R. t is time, and tdiff0
is the diffusion time at r = rd0 and t = 0 and ν is the viscosity. Traditionally, the
viscosity of the moon-forming disk is assumed to be controlled either by the
instability-driven viscosity61,62 or thermally driven viscosity44. The instability-
driven viscosity is caused by self-gravitating clumps forming from a gravitationally
unstable liquid layer inside the Roche radius. Inside the Roche radius, any self-
gravitating bodies will be destroyed by the planetary tide. The thermally driven
viscosity is caused by balancing heat generation by gravitational instability and
radiative cooling. Here, we consider a completely vapor disk, which is grav-
itationally stable, and therefore no clumping is possible. Thus, the viscosities
described above are not representative in our scenario. Here, we assume the tur-
bulent kinematic viscosity described as ν ¼ αc2

s

K is the
Keplerian angular velocity. α is unknown, but 10−3 has been used for a proto-
planetary disk and 10−6–10−2 has been used for the magneto-rotational instability

The timescale for the disk lifetime depends on the model. For the Moon-
forming disk, it is often considered to be ~100 years43,44 but the timescale estimates
range from 10s of years to 1000s of years16,44,64–66. Here, we assume that the disk
lifetime is comparable to the disk condensation timescale. Roughly speaking, the

L = 1.2 × 107 J kg−1 for rocky planets. Tph is the photospheric temperature.
Traditionally, the photospheric temperature of the Moon-forming disk has been
assumed to be ~2000 K44, but the temperature can be lower if heat transport to the
photosphere is not efﬁcient65. In this calculation, we assume the photospheric

reached. MD,ﬁnal/MD,initial ~ 0.2 for rocky planets in M = 0.1–6 M⊕, whereas
MD,ﬁnal/MD,initial < 0.06 for icy planets in the same mass range. This is because the
lifetime of an icy moon-forming disk is longer than that of a rocky moon-forming

(ρp = 1000 kg m−3, ρg = 10 kg m−3, Rp = 1.3 km). In this case, moonlets that
evaporate increase the vapor fraction of the disk, slowing down the cooling process.
It is possible that even more mass is lost to the planet during the cooling process. In
addition, small droplets (mm and cm in size) falling from the outer (colder) part of
the disk evaporate quickly due to the temperature difference between the droplets
and vapor16, but this evaporation process is slow and therefore not signiﬁcant for
km-sized moonlets.

Fig. 6 Schematic view of the mass range in which a fractionally large
exomoon can form by an impact. The horizontal axis represents the mantle
composition and the vertical axis represents the planetary mass normalized

smaller than 1 M⊕ are capable of forming fractionally large moons as
indicated by the orange shading. Our prediction is consistent with
planet–moon systems in the solar system.

disk due to its much smaller Tph. Thus, the disk loses its signiﬁcant portion of the
mass by viscous evolution. Needless to say, this is a very simple model that ignores
processes such as condensation, vapor-droplet interaction, and the Roche radius.
More detailed investigations are needed to track the evolution of the disk.

SPH simulations setting. We use an SPH code that we developed from the ground
up. This code has been extensively tested18,20,35. We use the semi-analytical equation of
state called M-ANEOS to represent silicate rock (forsterite) and iron. The forsterite EOS
we use here is “SPH-N” in previous work69, where VMF can depend on the choice of
an M-ANEOS input ﬁle. For ice, we used the ﬁve-phase EOS for water70 for the range
between 0 and 20,000 K and density smaller than 5000 kg m−3. Outside of this range,
the water EOS is interpolated using the table and SESAME 7154 EOS.

In most of the simulations, the initial entropy values of the mantles are 3165 J K−1 kg−1

and 3696 J K−1 kg−1 for rocky and icy planets, respectively. These values correspond to
surface temperatures ~2000 K and 300 K for an Earth-sized planet, respectively. The
exception is Run ID1 (Table 1) uses 1096 J K−1 kg−1. This corresponds to ~300 K at the
surface.

The vapor mass fraction of a disk is determined assuming that the disk has a

uniform entropy regardless of the radial distance and that the disk is in a
hydrostatic equilibrium. The detailed method is described in our previous
publication20. The disk’s mass, surface density, and angular momentum are directly
calculated from the SPH simulation and are listed in Table 1.

Disk model. Figure 4 shows the disk structure for a rocky planetary impact. The
skyeblue line represents an exponential surface density model
(σðrÞ ¼ ðc1
þ c2rÞ expð(cid:2)c3rÞ) and here we pick values that satisfy dσ/dr = 0 at the

It is possible to have the non-negligible amount of solid or liquid in the disk if

its VMF is smaller than 1 and MT is large. For example, in Run ID19, the disk
liquid mass is 0.129 × 6M⊕ × (1 − γ) × (1 − VMF) ~ 0.001 M⊕. If the entire mass is
in one object, the radius is ~640 km. Its residence time would be ~230 days, which
can be large enough to make a difference in the moon accretion process.
Nevertheless, this is an unlikely scenario given that VMF tend to be uniform
throughout the disk (Figs. 4 and 5 as well as previous work20), making it unlikely to
have a local concentration of melt.
