ABSTRACT
Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a new avenue to test Einstein‚Äôs General Relativity (GR) using the ongoing and upcoming
GW detectors by measuring the redshift evolution of the effective Planck mass proposed by several modified theories of gravity.
We propose a model-independent, data-driven approach to measure any deviation from GR in the GW propagation effect by
combining multi-messenger observations of GW sources accompanied by EM counterparts, commonly known as bright sirens
(Binary Neutron Star(BNS) and Neutron Star Black Hole systems(NSBH)). We show that by combining the GW luminosity
distance measurements from bright sirens with the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements derived from galaxy
clustering, and the sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we can make a data-driven
reconstruction of deviation of the variation of the effective Planck mass (jointly with the Hubble constant) as a function of cosmic
redshift. Using this technique, we achieve a precise measurement of GR with redshift (z) with a precision of approximately 7.9%
for BNSs at redshift z=0.075 and 10% for NSBHs at redshift z=0.225 with 5 years of observation from LVK network of detectors.
Employing CE&ET for just 1 year yields the best precision of about 1.62% for BNSs and 2% for NSBHs at redshift z=0.5 on the
evolution of the frictional term, and a similar precision up to z=1. This measurement can discover potential deviation from any
kind of model that impacts GW propagation with ongoing and upcoming observations.

1 INTRODUCTION

The General Theory of Relativity (GR) has stood as a cornerstone of
our understanding of gravity for over a century. It elegantly explains
how massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime, causing other ob-
jects to move along curved trajectories. However, in extreme astro-
physical environments such as black holes and the early universe, the
GR faces challenges in its applicability (Thorne 1995; Sathyaprakash
& Schutz 2009). Recently, a groundbreaking development occurred
with the direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by the LIGO-
Virgo collaboration (Abbott et al. 2016b,c; Scientific et al. 2017;
Abbott et al. 2017a; Goldstein et al. 2017). This achievement has
opened a new avenue for testing GR, particularly in the context of
compact binary systems existing in relativistic regimes. These sys-
tems include Binary Neutron Stars (BNS), Neutron Star-Black Hole
pairs (NSBH), and Binary Black Holes (BBH). These compact bina-
ries offer unprecedented opportunities to delve into the fundamental
nature of gravity across a vast range of mass scales and cosmologi-
cal distances. Ground-based detectors like LIGO (Aasi et al. 2015),
Virgo(Acernese et al. 2014) and KAGRA (Akutsu et al. 2021) have
played pivotal roles in this endeavor. Furthermore, the prospect of fu-
ture space-based detectors such as LISA (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017)
and ground-based detectors such as LIGO-Aundha (LIGO-India)

the Einstein Telescope(ET) (Punturo et al. 2010) holds even greater
promise for advancing our understanding of gravity and rigorously
testing GR‚Äôs predictions. Through these combined efforts, we aim
to refine and expand our comprehension of the intricate interplay
between gravity and the cosmos. While various models proposing
modifications to the theory of gravity have been put forth to address
different scenarios, this study is dedicated to testing GR in the prop-
agation of GW through a model-independent, data-driven approach.
GWs and EM signals‚Äô propagation speed and luminosity distance of-
fer insight into modified gravity theories. Factors like graviton mass,
frictional term(due to running effect of Planck mass) and anisotropic
source term contribute to deviations (Deffayet & Menou 2007; Saltas
et al. 2014; Nishizawa 2018; Belgacem et al. 2018a,b; Lombriser &
Taylor 2016; Lombriser & Lima 2017). Precise measurements en-
able rigorous testing of these alternative theories. Employing bright
sirens that emit both GW and EM radiation provides a robust avenue
for conducting meticulous assessments of GW propagation speed,
graviton mass, and the frictional term(ùõæ(z), see in Equation.2). The
prompt measurement of the electromagnetic counterpart, occurring
approximately 1.7 seconds after the BNS event GW170817, has fa-
cilitated the imposition of exceedingly precise constraints on the
speed of gravitational wave propagation and the mass of the graviton
(Abbott et al. 2017a,b, 2019a).

Various model-dependent parametrizations of ùõæ(ùëß) exist in the

Figure 1. This plot showcases the precision achievable in reconstructing the redshift variation of the Planck mass captured by F (ùëß) for both NSBH and BNS
systems, employing the current LVK detector with 5 years of observation time and the future CE&ET detectors with 1 year of observation time. For LVK, the
BNS case considers the total events corresponding to a local merger rate ùëÖ0 = 500 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1, while for NSBH, ùëÖ0 = 20Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1. For CE&ET, the BNS
scenario assumes ùëÖ0 = 100 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1, and for NSBH, ùëÖ0 = 20 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1 are used. The plot illustrates the enhanced accuracy in measuring the function F (ùëß)
using future detectors compared to our current instruments is possible in the redshift range 0.2 to 1 which is an interesting cosmic epoch when the acceleration
of the Universe becomes important.

literature, and one such example is the (Œû0, ùëõ) parametrization (Bel-
gacem et al. 2018b) and its detectability is shown for LVK (Leyde
et al. 2022) and LISA (Baker & Harrison 2021). This parameter-
ization depends on two positive parameters, denoted as Œû0 and n.
When Œû0 is set to 1, it corresponds to GR. There exist several mod-
els of modified gravity, each providing predictions for the frictional
term in various scenarios. One prominent category is Scalar-Tensor
theories. These theories encompass a scalar degree of freedom, the
dynamics of which play a pivotal role in the evolution of the uni-
verse. Among the most well-known scalar-tensor theories of gravity
are the Brans‚ÄìDicke theory (Brans & Dicke 1961), f(R) gravity (Hu
& Sawicki 2007) and covariant Galileon models (Chow & Khoury
2009). These belong to the broader class known as Horndeski theo-
ries. Beyond Horndeski theories, we have Degenerate Higher Order
Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories (Frusciante et al. 2019; Crisostomi
et al. 2016; Achour et al. 2016). These have been constructed and
represent, thus far, the most general scalar-tensor theories that propa-
gate a single scalar degree of freedom alongside the helicity-2 mode
of a massless graviton. There are several other well known modified
gravity exist in the litarature such as f(Q) gravity, f(T) gravity (Cai
et al. 2016), bigravity De Felice et al. (2021), gravity in some extra
dimensions (Dvali et al. 2000; Yamashita & Tanaka 2014; Corman
et al. 2021) and so on. In addition, there exist additional parameteri-
zations (Belgacem et al. 2018b), with the most significant being the
polynomial-exponential and exponential parameterizations.

These models exhibit variations from one another(Belgacem et al.
2019) from the power-law form which cannot be captured by Œû0
and ùëõ. It is worth mentioning that for this particular parametrization,
the fitting formula for ùõæ(z) becomes less accurate in both low and
high redshifts in comparison to some of the models (see for example
(Deffayet & Menou 2007)). Additionally, beyond this limited range
of models, the integrated effect of ùõæ(ùëß) may differ from a simple
power-law form in reality. As a result, it is important to be able to test

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì14 (2023)

GR in a model-independent way and measure the integrated effect of
ùõæ(ùëß) as a function of the data.

To address these issues, we introduce a novel model-independent
function, denoted as F (ùëß), defined in Equation 4. This function F (ùëß)
is specifically designed to account for any deviation from the GR. It
serves as a metric for assessing the disparity between the distances
denoted dGW

Figure 1, highlighting the enhanced precision in measuring the
redshift-dependent variation of the Planck mass (F (ùëß)) for NSBH
and BNS systems. Notably, the precision achieved is approximately
7.9% for BNS systems at redshift 0.075 and 10% for NSBH systems
at redshift 0.225 over a 5-year observation period from the LVK
network of detectors. Furthermore, employing CE&ET for just 1 year
yields remarkable precision, reaching about 1.62% for BNS systems
and 2% for NSBH systems at redshift 0.5, assuming a fixed Hubble
constant. However, when considering a varying Hubble constant, the
error bar increases to approximately 2 to 2.2 times that of a fixed
Hubble constant. Figure 1 also emphasizes that the measurement of
F (ùëß) is particularly improved in the redshift range of 0.2 to 1.0.
This improvement is attributed to two main factors: signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and the number of events. For a more detailed analysis,
refer to Section 6. In the (Œû0, n) frictional term parametrizations, Œû0
is set to 1 as the fiducial value. Notably, parameter which controls
the redshift evolution denoted by n lacks definition at this point.
Measuring n becomes challenging as Œû0 nears 1 (Belgacem et al.
2018b). Model-independent parametrization enables redshift scaling
for F(z), even for the GR value, in contrast to parametric forms.

The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we delve into
the propagation of GW beyond GR. Subsequently, we present our
proposed model-independent, data-driven reconstruction of the vari-
ation of the effective Planck mass(frictional term). In Section 3, we
shift our attention to the astrophysical population of GW sources
and explore their detection using both current and future detectors.

Figure 2. This is a schematic diagram demonstrates the measurement of three distinct length scales: the sound horizon (ùëüùë†), BAO scale (ùúÉùêµùê¥ùëÇ), and the GW
luminosity distance (ùëëùê∫ùëä
). These measurements are obtained from different independent observables such as CMB observations, galaxy correlation functions,
and gravitational wave sources. Using this signal, we can make a data-driven test of GR as a function of redshift using Equation 6.

Section 4 is dedicated to a comprehensive discussion on the model-
independent measurement of the BAO scale from the galaxy power
spectrum. In Section 5, we provide a detailed exposition of the for-
malism underpinning our work. Moving forward, Section 6 encapsu-
lates the main findings of our methodology, while Section 7 serves
as the culmination, summarizing our key discoveries and engaging
in a discourse on future prospects.

A modification of the the anisotropic stress term (Œ†+,√ó) affects
the phase of the binary waveforms; the recent BH‚ÄìBH observations,
in particular of GW150914 and GW151226, have set some limit
on such modifications, although for the moment not very stringent

The propagation of GW in the fabric of spacetime, as described by
the GR, can be mathematically expressed as follows

where ‚Ñé (+,√ó) is GW strain of plus (+) and cross (√ó) polarization,
the prime symbol denotes the derivative with respect to the confor-
mal time(ùúÇ) and H represents the Hubble parameter in comoving
coordinates. We utilize this equation as a starting point to examine
the propagation of GWs and evaluate the validity of the GR. The
modified theory of gravity generalizes this equation as follows

In this formulation, several additional parameters come into play.
Firstly, we have the frictional term denoted by ùõæ(ùëß), which represents
the influence of friction in the theory. The speed of GW propagation
is represented by ùëêùê∫ùëä , a is the scale factor and the graviton mass by
ùëöùê∫ùëä . Finally, the anisotropic stress term is denoted by Œ†(+,√ó) .

It is noteworthy that, within the framework of the GR, all these
additional parameters assume a fiducial value of zero, except for
ùëêùê∫ùëä , which corresponds to the speed of light(c). In the context
of testing GR through propagation, it is essential to scrutinize the
additional parameters and ascertain whether they deviate from the
values predicted by GR. Recent measurements, particularly from the
GW170817 event, have provided stringent constraints, indicating that
the graviton mass (ùëöùê∫ùëä ) is zero, and the speed of GW propagation

The presence of the frictional term ùõæ(z) changes the amplitude
of the GW signal received from a source at cosmological distance.
This is particularly interesting because it implies that the luminos-
ity distance measured with standard sirens is in principle different
from that measured with standard candles or other electromagnetic
probes such as CMB or BAO, and this could provide a ‚Äúsmoking
gun‚Äù signature of modified gravity. So as a consequence the GW lu-
minosity distance dGW
is related to the electromagnetic wave-based
luminosity distance dEM
by an exponential factor, where the expo-
nent involves integrating ùõæ(z‚Ä≤)/(1 + z‚Ä≤) with respect to ùëß‚Ä≤ (Belgacem
et al. 2018a). Consequently, the expression becomes

In our investigation, we focus on tensor perturbations, where the

tance can also be determined using the standard ŒõCDM cosmology,
such an approach is inherently model-dependent. To obtain a model-
independent data-driven inference of luminosity distance, we utilize
EM luminosity distance calculations derived from various length
scales.

Data-driven inference of luminosity distance: A data-driven ap-
proach to infer the luminosity distance can be made by using the
BAO angular peak position (ùúÉBAO) inferred from large scale struc-
ture observation (Peebles 1973). The position of the BAO peak in the
galaxy two-point correlation function can be inferred directly from
observation. The angular scales are related to the comoving sound
horizon until the redshift of drag epoch (ùëßùëë ‚àº 1020) as

The comoving sound horizon ùëüùë† at the drag epoch can be related
to the comoving sound horizon ùëü‚àó at the redshift of recombination
(ùëß‚àó = 1090) by ùëüùëë ‚âà 1.02ùëü‚àó. The quantity ùëü‚àó is inferred from CMB
observation, using the position of the first peak in the CMB tempera-
ture power spectrum ùúÉ‚àó = ùëü‚àó/(1 + ùëß‚àó)ùê∑ ùê∏ ùëÄ
ùê¥ (ùëß‚àó) (Spergel et al. 2007;
Komatsu et al. 2011; Hinshaw et al. 2013; Aghanim et al. 2020).

In the above equation, ùëëùê∫ùëä

(ùëß) is measured from GW sources,
ùúÉBAO is measured from galaxy two point correlation function, and
ùëüùë† is inferred from the CMB temperature fluctuations. The redshift
to the GW source can be inferred from EM counterpart for a bright
stand siren. As a result, the product of all these observable quantities
will lead to an identity value at all redshifts if GR and the fiducial
ŒõCDM model of cosmology is the correct theory. However, if there
is any departure from these models, then we can measure a deviation
from one with redshift. It is important to note that the value of ùëüùë†
depends on the redshift above ùëßùëë = 1020. Though it depends on
the model of cosmology, it is a redshift independent number of a
constant value for the low redshifts ùëß < 2. So, even if there is an
inaccuracy in the inference of true ùëüùë†, the value of F (ùëß) will vary
by an overall normalization. But the reconstructed redshift evolution
of F (ùëß) will remain the same. In one of the later sections, we will
show results for both the cases, (i) only F (ùëß) and (ii) F (ùëß) and
ùêª0 together. The second case will make it possible to marginalise
over any inaccurate inference of sound horizon ùëüùë† due to incorrect
inference of the Hubble constant.

Several alternative models of GR predict deviation in different
natures of the acceleration of the Universe that are predicted from the
ŒõCDM. As a result, this data-driven approach can make it possible to
explore both deviation from GR and ùë§ = ‚àí1 equation of state of dark
energy. The use of different observational probes was done previously
(Mukherjee et al. 2021a) for a parametric form of deviation from GR
(using Œû0 and ùëõ) valid for a class of model. However, the non-
parametric form using F (z) proposed in this analysis, can make a
redshift-dependent reconstruction of any deviation from GR using
the multi-messenger observations.

The redshift can be deduced through the EM counterparts as-
sociated with these bright sirens. Ongoing and upcoming missions
dedicated to identifying EM counterparts include DESI (Adame et al.
2023), Vera Rubin (Abell et al. 2009), Fermi (Bissaldi et al. 2009),
Swift (Burrows et al. 2005), HST (Scoville et al. 2007), Roman space
telescope (Eifler et al. 2021), Chandra (Vikhlinin et al. 2009), VLA

A comprehensive article on the required multi-messenger observa-
tions can be found here (Ronchini et al. 2022). For the measurement
of BAO scale, ongoing and upcoming missions are committed to
spectroscopic surveys. Notable projects in this regard include eBOSS
(Alam et al. 2017), DESI (Adame et al. 2023), Vera Rubin (Abell
et al. 2009), Euclid (Laureƒ≥s et al. 2011), and SPHEREx (Dor√© et al.
2018). CMB measurements from the ongoing and upcoming mis-
sions include ACTPol (Thornton et al. 2016), Simons Observatory
(Abitbol et al. 2019), SPT-3G (Sobrin et al. 2022) and CMB-S4
(Abazajian et al. 2016).

AND EINSTEIN TELESCOPE

3.1 Modelling of the astrophysical population of GW source

To accurately assess deviations from the GR model, it is crucial to
rely on real GW events. The total number of GW events is contingent
upon the merger rates, and mass population of the GW sources. We
will explain below the astrophysical models used in the analysis.

Merger rate: In this study we use a delay time model of the
binary mergers (Ochsner et al. 2012; Dominik et al. 2015). In the
delay time model, the merger rate is described in terms of the delay
time distribution, denoted as ùë°ùëë. The delay time refers to the elapsed
time between the formation of stars that will eventually become black
holes and the actual merging of these black holes. It is important to
note that the time delay is not uniform across all binary black holes
but instead follows a specific distribution. This distribution function
accounts for the variations in the delay time and is defined as follows:

ùëùùë° (ùë°ùëë |ùë°ùëöùëñùëõ

The delay time is given by ùë°ùëë = ùë°ùëö ‚àí ùë° ùëì , where ùë°ùëö and ùë° ùëì are the
lookback times of merger and formation respectively (Karathanasis
et al. 2023). So the merger rate at redshift z can be defined as

The parameter ùëÖ0 represents the local merger rate, indicating the
frequency of mergers at a redshift of z=0. According to the study in
Abbott et al. (2023), the estimated values of ùëÖ0 for BNS systems vary
between 10 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1 and 1700 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1. For NSBH systems,
the ùëÖ0 values range from 7.8 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1 to 140 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1.

In our study, we assume a standard local merger rate of ùëÖ0 =
20 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1 for NSBH systems. For BNS systems, we consider
four different scenarios with ùëÖ0 values of 100, 200, 300, and 500
Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1 respectively. This methodology allows us to examine the
effects of different local merger rates on our results. .

The numerator of the expression involves the integration over red-
shift ùëß ùëì from ùëß to infinity, where ùëùùë° (ùë°ùëë |ùë°ùëöùëñùëõ

ùëëùë°
time distribution, ùëÖùëÜùêπ ùëÖ (ùëß ùëì ) is the star formation rate, and
ùëëùëß ùëì is the
jacobian of the transformation. The star formation rate(ùëÖùëÜùêπ ùëÖ (ùëß)), is
determined using the Madau & Dickinson (2014) star formation rate.

where ùëáùëúùëèùë† indicates the total observation time,
ùëëùëß corresponds
to the comoving volume element, and ùëÖ(ùëß) denotes the merger rate
(Karathanasis et al. 2022). We consider the delay time merger rate
with a specific delay time ùë°ùëë = 500Myrs and a power-law exponent
of ùëë = 1. However, it is regrettable to note that not all of these events
can be detected due to the limitations imposed by the sensitivity
of our current detectors. To determine which events are detectable,
the calculation of the matched filtering signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
plays a crucial role. The SNR serves as a measure of the strength
of the gravitational wave signal relative to the background noise.
Only those events with a matched filtering SNR greater than or equal
to a predetermined threshold SNR (ùúåTH) can be reliably detected.
(Maggiore 2007)

For a GW emitted by an optimally oriented binary system, the
optimized SNR, denoted as ùúå, is defined as follows (Sathyaprakash

The function ‚Ñé( ùëì ) corresponds to the Gravitational Wave (GW) strain
in the restricted post-Newtonian approximation and is defined for plus

In this expression, the symbol ùúÇ represents the symmetric mass ratio.
The term ùëÄùëê signifies the chirp mass of the system. The variable
ùëëùêø denotes the luminosity distance. The constant c represents the
speed of light in a vacuum. I+ = (1 + cos2 ùëñ)/2 and I√ó = cos ùëñ
depends on the inclination angle ùëñ. Finally, Œ®( ùëì ) stands for the phase
of the waveform. However, the signal detected by a GW detector hdet
is a complex interplay of several variables, including the detection
antenna functions (ùêπ+, ùêπ√ó), and can be expressed as:

‚Ñédet = ùêπ+‚Ñé+ + ùêπ√ó ‚Ñé√ó,

by the LVK collaboration (Abbott et al. 2023; Talbot & Thrane
2018; Abbott et al. 2019b). To model the primary mass distribution
for black holes, we adopt a Power Law + Gaussian Peak model
with smoothing, which combines a power law distribution with the
inclusion of a Gaussian component encompassing masses ranging
from 10ùëÄ‚äô to 20ùëÄ‚äô. Conversely, we assume a uniform distribution
of masses for the secondary component of the neutron star, falling
within the range of 1ùëÄ‚äô to 2ùëÄ‚äô.

In this study, we employ two sets of GW detectors: one comprising
LIGO (Aasi et al. 2015), Virgo(Acernese et al. 2014) and KAGRA
(Akutsu et al. 2021)(LVK), and the other consisting of Cosmic Ex-
plorer (Reitze et al. 2019) and Einstein Telescope (Punturo et al.
2010) (CE&ET).

For the LVK system, a threshold SNR of ùúåTh = 12 is chosen.
For CE&ET, the threshold SNR is adjusted to enable the detection
of events up to a redshift of 3 (which corresponds to an SNR of
25 and 55 for BNS and NSBH respectively.). A redshift bin size
of Œîùëß = 0.025 is adopted, and within this bin, the total number of
events is computed using Equation 9. Events are generated based on
distances inferred from redshifts, the parameter Œò, and object masses
from their respective distributions.

For NSBH systems, the LVK‚Äôs 5-year operation is projected to
yield approximately 30 detectable events (all of them need not have
a detectable EM counterpart). However, with a one-year observation
period, the CE&ET are expected to identify around 600 events. In
the case of BNS systems, the LVK‚Äôs 5-year operation is anticipated
to result in approximately 25, 39, and 60 detectable events for local
merger rates (ùëÖ0) of 200, 300, and 500 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1 respectively. On
the other hand, CE&ET are expected to detect approximately 4800
events in a one-year observation period with ùëÖ0=100.

In Figure 3 and Figure 4, we present the projected total and de-
tectable coalescing events involving BNS and NSBH systems within
specific redshift intervals (Œîùëß). To obtain these estimates, we first
determine the number of merging events for each redshift bin using
Equation 9. For each event, we employ the inverse transform method
to derive the primary mass, secondary mass, and Œò from their respec-
tive probability distributions. The primary mass is generated within
the range of 10ùëÄ‚äô to 20ùëÄ‚äô, the secondary mass within 1ùëÄ‚äô to
2ùëÄ‚äô, and Œò within the interval 0 to 4. Incorporating redshift in-

formation for each event, we calculate the corresponding luminosity
distance and SNR using Equation 14 for a single detector. The total
SNR denoted as ùúåtotal, is then determined by combining individual
‚àöÔ∏É(cid:205)ùëñ ùúå2
SNRs from individual detectors using the formula ùúåtotal =
ùëñ .
This detection capability is evaluated using both the CE&ET and
LVK network of GW detectors over a defined observation period,
ùëáùëÇùêµùëÜ. The depicted curve in the graph illustrates the distribution
of these events up to a redshift of z = 4. This representation of-
fers valuable insights into the temporal occurrence of these mergers
throughout cosmic history and the likelihood of their successful de-
tection using current and future planned instrumentation.

3.2 GW Source Parameter Estimation using Bilby

We initiate the parameter estimation process for these discernible
sources by employing the Bilby (Ashton et al. 2019) package, which
yields realistic posterior distributions on the GW luminosity distance
marginalized over the other source parameters. The mass of the GW
sources and the number of sources with redshift are drawn as de-
scribed in the last section. For the remaining source parameters, such
as the inclination angle (ùëñ), polarization angle (ùúì), GW phase (ùúô),
right ascension (RA), and declination (Dec), we sample uniformly,
considering a non-spinning system. With these injected parame-
ters, we proceed to generate a GW signal using the IMRPhenomHM
(Kalaghatgi et al. 2020) waveform model. This model incorporates
higher-order modes that can alleviate the degeneracy between the
luminosity distance(ùëëùêø) and inclination angle(ùëñ) for unequal mass
sources. By constraining the priors of all other parameters to delta
functions 2, we generate posterior distributions for ùëö1, ùëö2, ùëëùêø and ùëñ.
Among these, the posterior of ùëëùêø is particularly crucial for our study,
as it will be used for the inference of F (ùëß). Additionally, the detection
probability of the electromagnetic counterpart is contingent on the
value of the inclination ùëñ (Chase et al. 2022; Ronchini et al. 2022).

2 We have assumed here that the RA and Dec are inferred from the EM
counterpart.

4 BARYON ACOUSTIC OSCILLATION SCALE FROM

GALAXY POWER SPECTRUM

Inference of BAO from galaxy two-point angular
correlation function: The BAO arises from the intricate
interplay between radiation pressure and gravity during the early
stages of the Universe. Previous works on this and corresponding
measurements can be found here (Peebles 1973; Crocce et al. 2011).
As photons and baryons decouple, a specific length known as the
sound horizon at the drag epoch (ùëßùëë), represented by ùëüùë†, leaves
a distinct signature on the distribution of galaxies and the power
spectrum of CMB anisotropies (Peebles & Yu 1970; Sunyaev &
Zeldovich 1970; Bond & Efstathiou 1987; Hu & Dodelson 2002;
Blake & Glazebrook 2003). By examining the two-point angular
correlation function (2PACF) of galaxy catalogs denoted by ùë§(ùúÉ),
one can identify the BAO signature, which manifests as a prominent
feature resembling a bump. The BAO scale can be derived by fitting
the angular correlation function ùë§(ùúÉ) with a model defined as a
combination of a power-law and a Gaussian component as (Xu et al.
2012; Carvalho et al. 2016; Alam et al. 2017)

where, the coefficients ùëéùëñ represent the parameters of the model,
ùúéùúÉ denotes the width of the BAO feature, and ùúÉùêπ ùêºùëá corresponds to
the best-fit value of the angular BAO scale. This signature serves
as a robust standard ruler, enabling independent measurements of
the angular diameter distance denoted as ùëë ùê¥(ùëß) (Peebles & Hauser
1974; Davis & Peebles 1983; Hewett 1982; Hamilton 1993; Landy
& Szalay 1993).

where ùúô(ùëß) is the galaxy selection function and ùëóùëô is the spherical
Bessel function of the lth order, and r(z) is the comoving distance.
To improve the convergence of the integral for the angular power
spectrum, a damping factor ùëí (‚àíùëò2/ùëò2
is introduced (Anderson
et al. 2012). Throughout the calculations, we adopt a fixed value of
1/ùëòùëí ùëì ùëì = 3 Mpc/h, which has no significant impact on the angular
power spectrum for the scales of interest.

ùëí ùëì ùëì )

In this study, we calculate the matter power spectrum from the
module CAMB (Lewis & Challinor 2011), and the selection function
on redshift is formulated as a normalized Gaussian function. The
standard deviation of this Gaussian function is set to be 5% of the
mean value. The anticipated photo-z error for the Vera Rubin Ob-
servatory is described by the expression 0.03(1 + ùëß), as referenced
in (Mandelbaum et al. 2018). Figure 5 visually demonstrates how
the product of ùúÉ2ùë§(ùúÉ) changes with angular separation at a specific

linear matter power spectrum as a function of ùúÉ and ùúÉ ‚Ä≤ for a specific redshift,

matrix also increases indicating larger error at the large angular scales.

redshift ùëß = 0.125. The prominent peak at ùúÉ ‚àº 16.0 is a significant ob-
servation, highlighting the characteristic scale associated with BAO,
which is crucial for our study.

Here, 1/ùëõ is the shot noise which is related to the number density of

ùëìùë†ùëò ùë¶ represents the fraction of the sky that is covered by the survey or
observation (Cabr√© et al. 2007; Dodelson & Schmidt 2020). Figure 6
illustrates how the covariance matrix, derived from the linear matter
power spectrum, changes concerning angular separations at a specific
redshift. The increase in the covariance matrix as both ùúÉ and ùúÉ‚Ä≤ rise
suggests a correlation between these angular scales. Figure 7 provides
a comprehensive view of how the BAO scale and its error (calculated
by using Equation 15) evolve with redshift, emphasizing the impact
of photo-z inaccuracies. The consistent relative error observed across
measurements serves as a key finding, shedding light on the reliability
of BAO scale determinations in the given redshift range. In future
work on the application of this technique to data, one can estimate
the covariance matrix from simulations.

Several detectors are set to measure the BAO scale with impressive
accuracy, delving into the depths of the universe‚Äôs redshift. Among
these detectors, DESI (Adame et al. 2023) stands out as a ground-
breaking 5-year experiment on the ground, specifically designed to
investigate BAO and the changes in cosmic structures as seen through
redshift-space distortions. Covering a vast area of 14,000 square de-
grees in the sky ( ùëìsky = 0.3), DESI aims to achieve extremely precise
measurements of the BAO feature. The goal is to surpass an impres-
sive precision of 0.5%, focusing on redshift intervals 0.0 < ùëß < 1.1,
1.1 < ùëß < 1.9, and 1.9 < ùëß < 3.7 (Adame et al. 2023). Additionally,
Euclid (Laureƒ≥s et al. 2011) and the Vera Rubin Observatory (Abell
et al. 2009; Iveziƒá et al. 2019), covering a vast sky area of 18,000
square degrees will be able to make precise measurements of BAO
up to high redshift.

Figure 7. We depict the relationship between the BAO scale along with the
associated error (in red), primarily arising from photo-z inaccuracies, as a
function of redshift (z) up to z = 0.5. This presentation offers crucial insights
into how the BAO scale and its error vary with z, highlighting a consistent
relative error across measurements. For visual clarity, the error values on the
plot have been magnified by a factor of 2.

5.1 Case with the fixed Hubble constant ùêª0

The intricate connection between the EM wave luminosity distance
at a specific redshift (z) and key cosmological parameters, including
the BAO scale (ùúÉ ùêµ ùê¥ùëÇ) and the sound horizon (ùëüùë†), is succinctly

with three distinct length scales (i)GW luminosity distance:
The luminosity distance for detectable GW events which is deter-
mined using Bilby. (ii) BAO scale(ùúÉ ùêµ ùê¥ùëÇ): We utilize the BAO
scale, derived from the 2PACF using the Equation 15. This method

is not bound to any particular survey, affording us the flexibility to
apply our methodology across a range of surveys without being re-
stricted to a specific one. (iii) Sound Horizons distance:The
sound horizon is measured by analyzing acoustic oscillations in the
CMB radiation using several missions such WMAP (Hinshaw et al.
2013), Planck (Aghanim et al. 2020), ACTPol (Thornton et al. 2016),
SPT-3G (Sobrin et al. 2022), and CMB-S4 (Abazajian et al. 2016).
In particular, the first peak observed in the angular power spectrum
of the CMB corresponds to the scale of the sound horizon during the
process of recombination. The measured sound horizon value at the
drag epoch is found to be 147.09 ¬± 0.26 Mpc, indicating a high level
of precision from Planck (Aghanim et al. 2020).

We utilize a Hierarchical Bayesian framework to calculate the pos-
terior distribution of F (ùëß) as a function of redshift for a total of ùëõùê∫ùëä
GW sources. The equation representing the posterior distribution on
F (z) for bright sirens is given as (Mukherjee et al. 2021a)

sponds to the likelihood function. ùëÉ(ùëüùë†) and ùëÉ(ùúÉùëñ
ùêµùê¥ùëÇ) denote the
prior probability distributions for the sound horizon (ùëüùë†) and BAO
scale respectively. The term Œ†(F (ùëß)) represents the prior distribu-
tion for F (ùëß), which encapsulates our knowledge or assumptions
about the frictional term before incorporating the measured data.
We adopt a flat prior on the frictional term, F (ùëß) from 0.1 to 2.
For this investigation, we make specific assumptions regarding the
probability distribution of redshift(z) and prior to the frictional term
F (ùëß). In this analysis, we consider bright sirens only. So, we assume
that the host galaxy redshift of the GW sources is measured spectro-
scopically. In this case, it implies that we have precise knowledge or
assume that the redshift of the sources is concentrated at a particular
value.

In Figure 8, we presented the measurement of F (ùëß), with a fixed
value of ùêª0 for both the CE&ET and the LVK system, focusing on a
single event. This plot illustrates a notable trend where the measure-
ment error increases with higher redshifts. Additionally, it discerns
that, at the same redshift, the error on F (ùëß) is more pronounced for
BNS systems compared to NSBH systems, attributed to the lower
SNR observed for BNS events.

5.2 Case with varying the Hubble constant ùêª0

In the preceding sections, our analysis primarily focused on evalu-
ating the frictional term denoted as F (ùëß) in Equation 20, assuming
a fixed Hubble constant (ùêª0). However, in this section, we jointly
infer both F (ùëß) and ùêª0. This extension enables the simultaneous
estimation of both the frictional term F (ùëß) and ùêª0, derived from
sound horizon measurements that remain constant across redshift,
serving as an overall normalization on F (ùëß) measurements.

Employing a hierarchical Bayesian analysis, our unified framework
efficiently estimates these two parameters by incorporating diverse

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì14 (2023)

observational datasets, including GW measurements, CMB measure-
ments, and large-scale structure surveys, as discussed in previous
sections. The hierarchical organization of these datasets ensures ro-
bust integration, effectively handling their unique uncertainties and
systematics. The resulting correlated constraints significantly con-
tribute to our understanding of cosmological phenomena, address-
ing potential discrepancies between datasets and revealing insightful
connections among fundamental cosmological parameters.

Bayesian framework, we adopt a flat prior assumption, indicating a
lack of prior knowledge about the parameters for both the frictional
term (F (ùëß)) and the cosmic expansion rate (ùêª0). The parameter
ranges are defined from 0.1 to 2.0 for F (ùëß) and from 40 km/s/Mpc
to 100 km/s/Mpc for ùêª0.

In Figure 9, we present measurements of F (ùëß) with varying values
of ùêª0 for both the CE&ET and the LVK system, focusing on the total
number of events within each redshift bin (mentioned in the paren-
thesis in the upper x-axis in the plot). This plot reveals a discernible
trend, indicating an increase in measurement errors with higher red-
shifts. Notably, due to the higher likelihood of BNS events compared
to NSBH events, we can achieve a more accurate measurement of
F (ùëß) for BNS events than for NSBH events.

6.1 Reconstruction of F (ùëß)

This study exclusively focuses on bright sirens, indicating NSBH
and BNS mergers with distinct EM counterparts (Nakar et al. 2018;
Kasliwal et al. 2017; Arcavi 2018; Troja et al. 2017; Hallinan et al.

Janka et al. 1999; Foucart 2012; Foucart et al. 2018). These include
short GRBs and high-energy gamma-ray bursts detected by satellites
like Fermi (Bissaldi et al. 2009) and Swift (Burrows et al. 2005). Ad-
ditionally, kilonovae generate bright optical and infrared transients,
offering insights into heavy element formation. Observatories like
the Vera Rubin (Abell et al. 2009), HST (Scoville et al. 2007), and
the upcoming Roman space telescope (Eifler et al. 2021) are poised
to capture these events. Post-merger, afterglows spanning X-ray, UV,
optical, and radio wavelengths are scrutinized with instruments such
as Chandra (Vikhlinin et al. 2009), VLA Benz & Guedel (1989),
ZTF (Bellm 2014), Astrosat (Agrawal 2006), Daksha (Bhalerao et al.
2022) and GMRT (Bhattacharyya et al. 2016).

Detecting EM counterparts in BNS and NSBH mergers poses
challenges related to prompt collapse, ejecta mass, and orientation.

with wider angles increasing detectability. Distance, instrument sen-
sitivity, and rapid event localization further complicate detection. In
astrophysics, terms like "structured jets" and "off-axis viewing" de-
scribe these phenomena (Rees & M√©sz√°ros 1998; Ramirez-Ruiz et al.
2001; Kumar & Piran 2000). Coordinated efforts between GW and
EM observatories are vital for insights into these cosmic collisions.
Despite progress, challenges persist, requiring proximity, orientation,
and sensitivity considerations. Success relies on refining theoretical
models, combining GW and EM observations, and technological
advancements. Future endeavors aim to optimize multi-messenger
observations, deepen theoretical comprehension, and amplify the
detectability of NSBH merger EM counterparts.

In our study, we present cases for both the CE&ET and LVK
systems. Specifically for CE&ET, we showcase outcomes for up to
redshifts ùëß = 2 for different numbers of detectable events. In the case
of NSBH binaries, we consider a total of 30 events with a local merger
rate (ùëÖ0) set at 20 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1 in the LVK system. These events span
redshifts from 0.125 to 0.425. Similarly, for BNS systems, we analyze
approximately 25, 40, and 60 events with ùëÖ0 set to 200 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1,
300 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1, and 500 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1, respectively. The redshifts of
these events range from 0.025 to 0.225 over a 5-year observation
period. In Figure 3 and Figure 4, the number of detectable events as
a function of redshift with different ùëÖ0 and ùëáùëúùëèùë† are presented for
the LVK and CE&ET systems.

Figure 10 and Figure 11 provide a comprehensive comparison of
F (ùëß) measurements with fixed ùêª0 and varying ùêª0 across different
scenarios for both LVK and CE&ET. These scenarios include the de-
tection of a single event, a quarter of the events, half of the events, and
the detection of all events. The aim is to demonstrate how the preci-

sion of measurements, ranging from percentages to sub-percentages,
can be achieved using future detectors. This comparative analysis
sheds light on the impact of event detection rates on the precision
of F (ùëß) measurements and underscores the potential of advanced
detectors like CE&ET to provide increasingly accurate cosmological
insights. In this section, we measure F (ùëß) with a constant ùêª0 that
remains uniform across redshifts, serving as an overall normaliza-
tion factor for F (ùëß) measurements. Consequently, if an independent
precise measurement of F (ùëß) in our local universe is possible, it will
allow us to normalize it to 1, eliminating the dependence on ùêª0. This
normalization proves effective particularly for low redshifts, where
the cumulative effects of modified gravity wave propagation have not
had sufficient time to accumulate deviations from GR.

The error associated with the frictional term approximately scales
as the inverse of the square root of the number of GW sources repre-
sented as 1/
NGW. This implies that as the number of GW sources
increases, the error on the frictional term decreases, thereby improv-
ing the precision of the measurement. However, this improvement
reaches a saturation point, beyond which an increase in the number
of GW sources does not lead to a significant enhancement in the mea-
surement‚Äôs accuracy. This saturation is primarily due to the presence
of error on the BAO scale. The BAO scale error acts as a limiting
factor in the precision of the frictional term estimation. Therefore,
to achieve further improvement in the estimation of the frictional
term with redshift, a more precise measurement of the BAO scale is
required. In essence, the precision of the frictional term estimation
is a delicate balance between the number of GW sources and the
accuracy of the BAO scale measurement and GW luminosity dis-
tance. Optimizing these factors can lead to significant advancements

Figure 9. This violin plot illustrates the posterior on the reconstruction of the non-GR parameter F (ùëß) as a function of cosmic redshift is feasible from LVK (in
green) and CE&ET (in blue). The top and bottom plot relates to possible measurement using one BNS and NSBH source respectively jointly with the Hubble
constant. The upper x-axis denotes the associated 1-ùúé error bars for each measurement, with the number in parentheses representing the total number of events
in that specific redshift bin. The plot highlights the potential for more accurate measurements of F (ùëß) at significantly deeper cosmic redshifts, particularly with
future detectors like CE&ET, in contrast to the limitations posed by our current LVK detector, similar to the case with fixed Hubble constant. Additionally, it
underscores that we can achieve more precise measurements of F (ùëß) for BNS systems compared to NSBH events, given the higher likelihood of BNS events
occurring.

Figure 10. We show the 1-ùúé error-bar in the measurements of F (ùëß) as a function of redshift and the number of GW events for NSBH events. The comparison
is made between scenarios with a constant Hubble constant (ùêª0) and for the case with ùêª0 inferred jointly with F (ùëß). All the events at each redshift bin are
mentioned in parentheses in the figure legend.

(ùëß) will markedly enhance the accuracy of F (ùëß), as ùëëùê∫ùëä

in our understanding of F (ùëß) and discovering unexplored territories
in fundamental physics. On the GW side, the measurements of F (ùëß)
are solely dependent on ùëëùê∫ùëä
(ùëß). Any improvement in the precision
of ùëëùê∫ùëä
(ùëß)
ùëô
stands out as the predominant source of error for F (ùëß). Given that
ùëëùê∫ùëä
(ùëß) is degenerate with other GW parameters, most notably the
ùëô
inclination angle (ùëñ), measuring inclination angle from alternative
sources (such as EM counterparts) can substantially reduce the error
in ùëëùê∫ùëä
(ùëß) and consequently enhance the precision of F (ùëß) (Xie
ùëô
et al. 2023). For redshift inference from EM counterparts, the in-
fluence of peculiar velocity contamination is particularly significant
at low redshifts (ùëß < 0.03) but it is not important for high redshift
(Mukherjee et al. 2021b; Nimonkar & Mukherjee 2024). As most
of the detected sources are at high redshift, we have ignored this
effect. Also, weak lensing of the GW sources can be a source of
contamination to the luminosity distance up to a few percent at red-
shifts above ùëß = 0.5 (Hirata et al. 2010). In comparison to the error
bar on luminosity distance, the weak lensing error bar is small. As
most of the sources with better luminosity distance measurement are
mainly at low redshift (ùëß < 0.5), we are getting maximum constraints
around this redshift. So, the weak lensing uncertainty is not a major
contamination for these sources. Moreover, weak lensing can pro-
vide additional information to constraint non-GR parameter space
(Mukherjee et al. 2020a,b; Mpetha et al. 2023; Balaudo et al. 2023),
which we have not considered in this analysis.

6.2 Reconstruction of F (ùëß) and ùêª0

By extension of the hierarchical Bayesian framework used in the pre-
vious section to measure F (ùëß) with fixed ùêª0, we can jointly measure
F (ùëß) and ùêª0. In our framework, we measure the EM luminosity
distance from different length scales, namely the BAO scale, sound
horizon distance, and redshift. In Figure 10 and Figure 11, we offer
a thorough comparison of F (ùëß) measurements with both fixed and

varying ùêª0 across different scenarios for both the LVK and CE&ET
systems. It is noteworthy that when allowing for variations in ùêª0,
the errors in the measurements of F (ùëß) increased by a factor ranging
from 2 to 2.2 compared to measurements with a fixed ùêª0. In Figure
1, we highlight the enhanced precision in measuring the redshift-
dependent variation of the Planck mass (F (ùëß)) for NSBH and BNS
systems. The figure emphasizes that the measurement of F (ùëß) is
notably improved in the redshift range of 0.2 to 1.0. The precision
of estimating F (ùëß) depends on accurate measurements of both the
BAO scale and ùëëùê∫ùëä
(ùëß). Improved accuracy in the BAO scale mea-
surements directly enhances precision in estimating F (ùëß). On the
GW side, accurate measurements of F (ùëß) rely solely on ùëëùê∫ùëä
(ùëß).
Enhancing the precision of ùëëùê∫ùëä
(ùëß) improves F (ùëß), as mentioned in
the previous Subsection 6.1. There can also be peculiar velocity cor-
rections and weak lensing contamination at low redshift as described
in 6.1 which are not taken care of in this study.

7 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this study, we present a model-independent approach to search
for the frictional term, which can capture deviations at any redshift
from GR. We propose a model-independent reconstruction of the
frictional term as a function of redshift using a data-driven approach
by amalgamating three length scales with redshift namely the lumi-
nosity distance from GW sources ùëëGW
(ùëß), the angular scale of BAO
ùëô
scale from galaxy surveys ùúÉBAO (ùëß), and the sound horizon ùëüùë† from
CMB observations. We show this provides a unique opportunity to
scrutinize theories of gravity, specifically to test the presence of a
frictional term. In the literature, various model-dependent searches
for the frictional term have been conducted. These searches face chal-
lenges, especially near redshift z=0 and at large redshifts. Particularly
noteworthy are the difficulties encountered when there is a potential
loss of gravitons in extra dimensions. Furthermore, in the interme-

diate redshift range, the frictional term may display oscillatory be-
havior that cannot be adequately captured by these model-dependent
searches.

We demonstrate that by integrating BAO measurements from
galaxies, sound horizon distances from the CMB power spectrum,
redshift information from the EM counterpart, and luminosity dis-
tance measurements from GW sources, one can perform a compre-
hensive measurement of cosmological parameters. Specifically, we
highlight the potential to jointly determine the Hubble constant (ùêª0)
and the frictional term through this integrated analysis. We have
demonstrated the feasibility of measuring the frictional term using
our ongoing detectors, such as LVK, across various redshifts. Ad-
ditionally, we have explored the capabilities of upcoming detectors,
specifically CE&ET, in quantifying the frictional term under various
scenarios. Our analysis includes cases where a fraction of the event‚Äôs
EM counterpart is detectable, acknowledging the inherent difficulty
in detecting EM counterparts.

We demonstrate the feasibility of achieving a precision measure-
ment of the frictional term, ranging from a percent to sub-percent
accuracy, as a function of cosmic redshift. This is achievable using
data from LVK and, in the future, from CE&ET, despite the limita-
tion of a finite number of bright sirens. The measurement of F (ùëß)
is particularly improved in the redshift range of 0.2 to 1.0. This im-
provement is attributed to two main factors: SNR and the number
of events. The measurements from LVK can be further improved by
including LIGO-India (Saleem et al. 2021)3.

In the (Œû0, n) parametrizations of the frictional term, the fiducial
value for Œû0 is set to 1. However, it is important to note that the
parameter n is not defined at this fiducial value of Œû0=1. Conse-
quently, measuring the value of n becomes increasingly challenging
as Œû0 approaches 1 (Belgacem et al. 2018b). By utilizing 1000 bright
sirens up to redshift 8, Belgacem et al. (2018b) demonstrated that
Œû0 can be measured with an accuracy of 0.8% using the Einstein
Telescope for a fixed value of n. In our study, employing a model-
independent parametrization, we found that with 1 year of obser-
vation using CE&ET, we can measure the frictional term with an
accuracy of 1.62% and 2% for BNS and NSBH systems at redshift
0.5. Additionally, we can reconstruct the frictional term as a function
of redshift without relying on any specific parametrization, as illus-
trated in Figure 1. This error scales inversely with the square root of
the observation time, i.e., as 1/‚àöÔ∏Åùëáùëúùëèùë†/ùë¶ùëíùëéùëü ùë†.

Our proposed technique extends to dark sirens, where redshift
inference becomes necessary. In such cases, we leverage the three-
dimensional clustering scale of GW sources with galaxies to infer
redshift information (Mukherjee & Wandelt 2018; Mukherjee et al.
2020c; Abbott et al. 2021). Furthermore, this methodology holds
promise for both bright and dark standard sirens in the mHz range,
detectable by future space-based detectors like LISA. In this study,
our exclusive focus is on bright sirens, and as a result, we exclude
a prominent category of GW sources Binary Black Holes (BBH)
due to their unlikely association with EM counterparts. Additionally,
there are challenges associated with detecting EM counterparts for
BNS and NSBH systems (Chase et al. 2022; Ronchini et al. 2022).
One potential method to enhance the accuracy of frictional term
measurements is to include dark sirens, which lack EM counterparts.
In future, the integration of LIGO-India and the LISA GW detector,
in conjunction with projects such as eBOSS, DESI, Vera Rubin, and
Euclid for BAO measurements, along with the application of this

technique to dark sirens, holds the potential to substantially improve
the precision of measuring the frictional term.

APPENDIX A: UNCERTAINTIES IN ùêª0 IN THE
RECONSTRUCTION OF ùêª0 AND F (ùëç)

In Section 6.2, we extended the hierarchical Bayesian framework
previously employed for measuring F (ùëß) with a fixed ùêª0 to a joint
measurement scenario for both F (ùëß) and ùêª0. Within this framework,
a flat prior assumption was utilized, indicating a lack of prior knowl-
edge about the parameters associated with the frictional term (F (ùëß))
and the cosmic expansion rate (ùêª0). For the parameters governing the
frictional term (F (ùëß)) and the Hubble constant (ùêª0), we established
parameter ranges of 0.1 to 2.0 and 40 km/s/Mpc to 100 km/s/Mpc,
respectively.

In Figure A1, we showcase the joint posterior of F (ùëß) and ùêª0
for two distinct scenarios. The first scenario corresponds to CE&ET,
considering all observed events for z=0.225 in the case of NSBH
events. The second scenario pertains to LVK, also for z=0.225 also
focusing on NSBH events. This visualization provides a comparative
analysis, illustrating the potential advancements achievable with our
future detector, CE&ET, in contrast to the current capabilities of the
LVK detector. The joint posterior distribution offers valuable insights
into the precision and capabilities of each detector in estimating the
parameters F (ùëß) and ùêª0. In Figure A2 and Figure A3 we showed

Figure A1. In this plot, we depict the joint posterior of F (ùëß) and ùêª0 for
CE&ET and LVK for the NSBH events for a total number of events scenario
at z=0.225. In the parenthesis, it depicts the total no of events at that particular
redshift.

Figure A2. In this plot,we depict the Joint Posterior of F (ùëß) and ùêª0 upto 4
ùúé level for LVK for the NSBH events scenario at z=0.225 for one event.

Figure A3. In this plot, we depict the joint posterior of F (ùëß) and ùêª0 upto 4
ùúé level for CE&ET for the NSBH events scenario at z=0.225 for one event.
the joint posterior of F (ùëß) and ùêª0 for CE&ET and LVK at redshift
0.225 for just only one event.
