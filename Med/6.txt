ABSTRACT
Background: One of the complications aneurysms subarachnoid hemorrhage is the de-
velopment of vasospasm, which is the leading cause of disability and death from ruptured 
cerebral aneurysm. Aim: To evaluate the significance of previous comorbidities on early 
outcome of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by rupture of a cerebral an-
eurysm in the prevention of vasospasm. Patients and methods: The study had prospec-
tive  character  in  which  included  50  patients,  whose  diagnosed  with  SAH  caused  by  the 

rupture of a brain aneurysm in the period from 2011to 2013. Two groups of patients were 

formed.  Group  I:  patients  in  addition  to  the  standard  initial  treatment  and  “3H  therapy” 

administered nimodipine at a dose of 15-30 mg / kg bw / h (3-10 ml) for the duration of 

the  initial  treatment.  Group  II:  patients  in  addition  to  the  standard  initial  treatment  and 

“3H therapy” administered with MgSO4 at a dose of 12 grams in 500 ml of 0.9% NaCl / 24 
h during the initial treatment. Results: Two-thirds of the patients (68%) from both groups 
had a good outcome measured with values according to GOS scales, GOS IV and V. The 

poorer outcome, GOS III had 20% patients, the GOS II was at 2% and GOS I within 10% of 

patients. If we analyze the impact of comorbidity on the outcome, it shows that there is a 

significant relationship between the presence of comorbidity and outcomes. The patients 

without comorbidity (83.30%) had a good outcome (GOS IV and V), the same outcome 

was observed (59.4%) with comorbidities, which has a statistically significant difference (p 

= 0.04). Patients without diabetes (32%) had a good outcome (GOS IV and V), while the 

percentage of patients with diabetes less frequent (2%) with a good outcome, a statistical-
ly significant difference (p = 0.009). Conclusion: The outcome of treatment 30 days after 
the subarachnoid hemorrhage analyzed values WFNS and GOS, is not dependent on the 

method of prevention and treatment of vasospasm. Most concomitant diseases in patients 

with  SAH  which,  requiring  additional  treatment  measures  are  arterial  hypertension  and 

diabetes mellitus. The best predictors in the initial treatment of patients with subarachnoid 

hemorrhage caused by rupture of a cerebral aneurysm has the presence of comorbidity, 

which has statistical significance.

Key words: subarachnoid hemorrhage, vasospasm, comorbidity.

1. INTRODUCTION

Fifty  percent  of  survivors  have 
neurological  deficits.  Re-rupture 
usually  occurs  within  the  first  day 
and the risk is still very high for the 
first  two  weeks  (about  25%),  if  left 

untreated  (1,2).  One  of  the  com-
plications  aneurysm  subarachnoid 
hemorrhage  is  the  development  of 
vasospasm, which is a leading cause 
of  disability  and  death  from  rup-
tured cerebral aneurysm (3). Diseas-

Impact of comorbidity on Early Outcome of Patients with Subarachnoid hemorrhage

es caused by rupture of intracranial aneurysms are com-
plex and caused by genetic (4), and acquired risk factors 
(5),  whose  mechanisms  in  the  formation,  progress  and 
rupture of aneurysms are poorly understood. Type 2 di-
abetes has a complex trait that aff ects the changes in the 
arterial  wall  through  several  diff erent  mechanisms  (6). 
However,  combining  all  studies,  hypertension  remains 
an  important  risk  factor  (7).  Patients  who  used  antihy-
pertensive drugs may have a decreased risk for the for-
mation  and  growth  of  the  aneurysm  (8).  On  the  other 
hand, hypertension is associated with the development 
of  subarachnoid hemorrhage is an important risk factor 
for poor treatment outcome (9). Nimodipine is indicated 
for the treatment of ischemic neurological defi cits after 
subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by rupture of cerebral 
aneurysm  (10).  Clinical  studies  show  that  nimodipin 
reducing  neurological  defi cit  and  prevents  or  reduces 
vasospazam  (11,  12).  In  patients  with  stroke  and  SAH, 
magnesium is a convenient and secure (13, 14). Th  e ef-
fectiveness of magnesium in SAH is refl ected, in addition 
to its biochemical properties as a physiological antago-
nist of calcium, and ease of administration, low cost, able 
to measure and control the concentration in body fl uids, 
as well as a favorable safety profi le (15, 16).

2. PATIENTS AND METHODS

WFNS 

Study had prospective character in which included 50 
patients. Th  e subjects were patients admitted to the In-
tensive Case Unit (ICU) of the Clinic for Anesthesiology 
and  Reanimatology,  Neurology  Clinic  and  Neurosur-
gery Clinic Center Tuzla diagnosed with SAH caused by 
GCS 
the  rupture  of  a  cerebral  aneurysm  in  the  period  from 
2011  to  2013.  Inclusion  criteria  are:  patients  with  sub-
arachnoid  hemorrhage  caused  by  rupture  of  cerebral 
aneurysm,  patients  older  than  20  years  and  younger 
than  70  years,  patients  admitted  within  72  hours  after 
the occurrence of hemorrhage, patients who had initial 
measures  and  intensive  care  treatment  up  to  12  days 
Pupils 
after  the  occurrence  of  hemorrhage.  Exclusion  criteria 
are:  patients  underwent  surgical  treatment  due  to  sub-
arachnoid  hemorrhage  not  originating  from  aneurysm, 
patients previously underwent surgical treatment due to 
cerebrovascular disease, patients who are already treat-
ed  for  cancer  and  other  systemic  diseases.  Two  groups 
of  patients  are  formed:  Group  I:  patients  who  in  addi-
tion  to  the  standard  initial  treatment  and  “3H  thera-
py”  also received  nimodipine at a dose of  15-30 mg/kg 
bw/h (3-10 ml) for the duration of the initial treatment. 
Group  II:  patients  who  in  addition  to  the  standard  ini-
tial  treatment  and  “3H  therapy”  received  Mg  SO4  at  a 
dose of 12 g in 500 ml of 0.9% NaCl/2 h during the initial 
treatment.  All  patients  upon  admission  to  the  hospital 
underwent  native  brain  CT  which  confi rmed  the  exis-
tence  of  SAH,  and  after  that  CT  angiography  of  blood 
vessels  of  the  brain  which  revealed  the  existence,  size, 
shape and localization of cerebral aneurysm. All patients 
are  monitored  by  non-invasive  monitoring  of  vital  pa-
rameters:  state  of  consciousness,  blood  pressure,  heart 
rate,  respiratory  rate,  body  temperature,  CVP,  diuresis. 
State  of  consciousness  was  measured  by  the  Glasgow 

Coma  Scale–GCS.  Measures  of  initial  treatment  were 
analyzed according to the values of World Federation of 
Neurosurgical Society scale–WFNS. Patients were ana-
lyzed also on the existence of underlying diseases prior 
to admission to hospital: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
cardiovascular  diseases  and  previous  neurological  dis-
eases. For testing statistical signifi cance between groups 
were  used  parametric  or  non-parametric  tests,  χ2test 
and t-test. Statistical hypotheses were tested at the level 
of a = 0.05, or diff erences between samples were consid-
ered signifi cant if p <0.05. Regression analysis has deter-
mined the prognostic value of some potential predictors 
of treatment outcome after SAH (displayed as OR-odds 
ratio value).

3. RESULTS

Basic  demographic  and  clinical  characteristics  were 
analyzed according to the age, gender, GCS, WFNS and 
pupil’s examination at the hospital admission. Th  e clini-
cal characteristics were analyzed in form of existence of 
hypertension,  diabetes,  cardiomyopathy,  or  jointly  ob-
served as a comorbidity (Table 1).

Th  e  impact  of  comorbidity  on  the  outcome  of  the 

situation

If  we  analyze  the  impact  of  comorbidity  on  the  out-
come it is obvious that there is a signifi cant relationship 
between the presence of comorbidity and outcome. Th  e 
patients without comorbidity (83.30%) had a good out-

outcome, GOS III is present in higher percentage among 
patients  with  comorbidities  (21.9%)  than  in  patients 
without comorbidity (16.7%). Poor outcome (GOS I and 
II) was not present among patients without comorbidi-
ty, whereas in patients with comorbidity was present in 
18.8% (Figure 2). If we separately analyze the impact of 
hypertension as the most common form of comorbidi-
ty in patients with SAH there is a noticeable higher fre-
quency of negative outcomes in patients with hyperten-
sion,  and  this  relationship  is  almost  reaching  statistical 
signifi cance (p = 0.054) (Table 4). Also a diabetes is com-
mon comorbidity entity which have a signifi cant impact 
on  SAH  treatment  outcome.  Patients  without  diabetes 
(32%)  had  a  good  outcome  (GOS  IV  and  V),  while  the 
patients with diabetes only in 2% had a good outcome,

4. DISCUSSION

Among the comorbidity registered in our sample hy-
pertension  is  most  common  one  (30  patients  or  60%), 
followed by diabetes (6 patients or 12%). Th  ere were no 
signifi cant diff erences in the presence of comorbidity be-
tween  groups.  If  we  analyze  the  impact  of  comorbidity 
on the outcome it can be seen that there is a signifi cant 
relationship  between  the  presence  of  comorbidity  and 
the outcome. Results show that in case of hypertension 
as  the  most  common  form  of  comorbidity  in  patients 
with  SAH  there  is  a  higher  frequency  of  negative  out-
comes, and this relationship is almost reaching statistical 
signifi cance (p=0.054). Also diabetes represents a com-
mon  comorbidity  entity  and  had  a  signifi cant  impact 
on  SAH  treatment  outcome.  Patients  without  diabetes 
(32%) had a good outcome (GOS IV and V), while the pa-
tients with diabetes were only in 2% had good outcome, 
which represents a statistically signifi cant diff erence (p = 
0.009). Th  e patients without comorbidity (83.30%) had a 
good outcome (GOS IV and V), while the same outcome 
was  observed  (59.4%)  with  comorbidities,  which  has  a 
statistically  signifi cant  diff erence  (p=0.04).  Th  e  poorer 
outcome,  GOS  III  in  a  higher  percentage  was  present 
in  patients  with  comorbidities  (21.9%)  than  in  patients 
without comorbidity (16.7%). Poor outcome (GOS I and 
II)  was  not  present  among  patients  without  comorbid-
ity,  whereas  in  patients  with  comorbidity  was  present 
in  18.8%.  In  the  study  from  2010,  Ingawa  came  to  the 
conclusion  that  the  hypertension  was  the  most  power-
ful  risk  factor  for  the  aneurismal  formation,  regardless 
of age and sex, followed by hypercholesterolemia, heart 
disease,  smoking,  diabetes  and  that  daily  drinking  was 
insignifi cant  for  aneurismal  formation  (17).  Rasing 
and  associates  studied  2012  patients  with  SAH  caused 
by  rupture  of  cerebral  aneurysms  which  as  risk  factors 

If we separately analyze the impact of hypertension as the most common form of comorbidity in 
patients with SAH there is a noticeable higher frequency of negative outcomes in patients with 
hypertension, and this relationship is almost  reaching  statistical significance (p = 0.054)  (Table 
282
4).

Also a diabetes is common comorbidity entity which have a significant impact on SAH treatment

patients with diabetes only in 2% had a good outcome, which represents a statistically significant

had  hypertension  and  were  smokers.  The  increase  in 
RR  (relative  risk)  for  hypertension  was  found  in  wom-
en and in men, but an increase in RR for smoking was 
found only in women (18). Lindgren et al in 2013 pub-
lished a study claiming that type 2 diabetes does not in-
crease the risk of rupture of the aneurysm, but that his 
connection with the development of SAH, as the cause 
of ruptured aneurysms still remains unclear (19). In our 
study, is applied regression analysis, which is the model 
included all potential predictors of outcome. As poten-
tial predictors of outcome were considered: age, gender, 
presence of comorbidity, clinical condition at presenta-
tion, Fisher scale, and type of treatment (nimodipine or 
MgSO4). The best and one independent good predictor 
of outcome proved the presence of comorbidity, with OR 
value above 3.5. Unexpectedly, the clinical condition at 
presentation gradient WFNS scale has not proved to be 
a good predictor of outcome. Schmid-Elsaesser et al in 
2006 examined one hundred and thirteen patients with 
aneurysmal SAH infection and were randomized to re-
ceive either magnesium sulfate (10 mg/kg followed by 30 
mg/kg daily), or nimodipine (48 mg/d) injecting at least 
until the seventh postoperative day. There was no differ-
ence in the results between the groups. The effectiveness 
of magnesium in preventing delayed ischemic neurolog-
ical deficit in patients with aneurysmal SAH seems to be 
comparable to that of nimodipine. The difference in their 
pharmacological properties seems to raise the possibility 
of their combination (20). However, Van den Bergh, 2005 
proved  that,  MgSO4  infusion  reduces  ischemic  neuro-
logic deficit by 34% and fatalities by 23% (21). Mortality 
in patients with SAH is still very high, despite substantial 
qualitative progress in their treatment, the improvement 
of  microsurgical  and  endovascular  treatment  meth-
od  (the  adoption  of  new  insights  into  the  etiology  and 
pathophysiology of events after SAH and possibilities of 
medication complications) (22).

5. CONCLUSIONS

Patients  who  received  MgSO4  had  less  neurological 
deficits,  better  functional  recovery  in  the  initial  phase 
and  a  better  outcome  in  the  GOS-in,  but  without  sta-
tistical  significance.  The  outcome  of  treatment  30  days 
after the occurrence of SAH, analyzed values WFNS and 
GOS, is not dependent on the method of prevention and 
treatment of vasospasm. The most common comorbid-
ities  in  patients  with  aneurysms  SAH,  requiring  addi-
tional treatment measures are: arterial hypertension and 
diabetes  mellitus.  The  biggest  pro-activity  in  the  initial 
treatment  of  patients  with  subarachnoid  hemorrhage 
caused  by  rupture  of  cerebral  aneurysms  has  the  pres-
ence of comorbidity, which has statistical significance.
