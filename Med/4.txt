Abstract 

Background    The association of systolic blood pressure (SBP) with mortality in heart failure (HF) patients is paradoxical, and the time 
points of baseline SBP are also different across prior studies. We hypothesized that the levels of SBP at admission and at discharge had dif-
ferent associations with postdischarge events. Methods    The study population included patients hospitalized for decompensated HF in the 
Heart Failure Center of Fuwai Hospital from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2014. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascu-
lar (CV) death and heart transplantation. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards and restricted cubic spline analyses were used to assess the 
relationships between SBP at different time points and outcomes. Results    In total, 2005 patients were included with a median follow-up of 
48.4 months. The median age was 59 years, and 69.9% were male. Multivariate Cox analyses showed that compared with SBP < 105 mmHg, 
higher SBP at admission was associated with better long-term primary outcome (105–119 mmHg, HR = 0.764, P = 0.005; 120134 mmHg, 
HR = 0.658, P < 0.001; ≥ 135 mmHg, HR = 0.657, P = 0.001). Patients whose discharge SBP was higher than 135 mmHg had a similar pri-
mary outcome as those with SBP < 105 mmHg (HR = 0.969, P = 0.867), and the results remained unchanged even after adjusting for admis-
sion SBP (HR = 1.235, P = 0.291). The results of restricted cubic spline analysis indicated similar associations. Conclusions    Lower but not 
higher SBP at admission is associated with more CV deaths/heart transplantations (a reverse J-shaped curve). In contrast, there is a U-shaped 
association between discharge SBP and CV mortality/heart transplantation.

1    Introduction 

Hypertension has been considered a common risk factor 
for heart failure (HF).[1,2] It is believed that the development 
of HF could be prevented by anti-hypertensive treatment in 
high-risk  populations.[3–7]  However,  previous  studies  have 
found  inconsistent  results  on  the  effects  of  systolic  blood 
pressure  (SBP)  on  mortality  in  HF  patients.  According  to 
the Diet, Cancer and Health (DCH) cohort study, high base-
line blood pressure was related to adverse outcomes in inci-
dent HF patients.[8] Conversely, other studies[9–14] showed 
that  HF  patients  with  high  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP), 
even  higher  than  140  mmHg,[9,11,13]  had  a  better  prognosis

than those with low blood pressure, regardless of the time of 
SBP measurements (at admission or the so-called baseline). 
The changes in SBP in HF patients have been confirmed,[15] 
suggesting that SBP drops significantly after admission and   
steadily increases thereafter. In OPTIMIZE-HF,[9] although 
HF patients with high SBP (> 140 mmHg at admission) had 
better  outcomes,  their  mean  SBP  declined  to  120139 
mmHg at discharge. Different SBP levels at different times 
may reflect various conditions in HF patients. For example, 
during the decompensated phase, SBP level usually reflects 
short-term  “cardiovascular  reserve”,  and  SBP  during  the 
stable phase would have a long-term influence on outcomes. 
So  far,  it  is  unclear  whether  the  SBP  levels  at  different 
time-points have a similar association with adverse events. 
In this study, we hypothesized that the levels of SBP at ad-
mission and at discharge would have different associations 
with postdischarge outcomes in a cohort of HF patients hos-
pitalized for decompensated HF.

2    Methods 

2.1    Study population 

We retrospectively assessed patients hospitalized for de-
compensated HF at the Heart Failure Center of Fuwai Hos-
pital from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2014. For pa-
tients with multiple admissions, only the first admission was 
included in our analyses. The diagnosis of heart failure with 
reduced  ejection  fraction  (HFrEF)  was  according  to  the 
2012 European  Society  of  Cardiology guidelines,[16]  which 
was  based  on  typical  HF  symptoms/signs  and  a  left  ven-
tricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  less  than  40%.  For  those 
with  LVEF  ≥  40%,  in  addition  to  typical  symptoms/signs, 
the diagnosis of HF required one of the following conditions 
to  be  satisfied:  elevated  N-terminal  pro  B  type  natriuretic 
peptide (≥ 450 ng/L), HF history, left ventricular end-dias-
tolic diameter ≥ 55 mm, left atrial diameter ≥ 45 mm, inter-
ventricular septal or left ventricular posterior wall thickness 
≥ 12 mm, E/A< 1, and systolic/diastolic dysfunction, which 
was reported by qualitative assessment. Patients without any 
tumor, aortic dissection, stenosis of the renal artery or sec-
ondary hypertension were  enrolled  in  this  study. Addition-
ally,  those who  were  aged  < 18  years, had no  LVEF  data, 
had no data on New York Heart Association (NYHA) clas-
sification at admission, died or had a heart transplant during 
the  first  hospitalization,  were  discharged  with  a  left  ven-
tricular  assistance  device  or  continuous  intravenous  ino-
tropic therapy, or transferred to another hospital for further 
treatment  were  excluded.  All  patients  provided  written  in-
formed consent, and the ethics committee of Fuwai Hospital 
approved this study. 

2.2    Data collection 

Data on blood pressure (BP) at admission were  first  re-
corded in the nursing notes from medical records, and data 
on  BP  at  discharge  were obtained from  the  electronic  pro-
gress  notes  of  the  day  of  discharge.  Both  BPs  were  meas-
ured by an electronic sphygmomanometer in arm by nurses. 
The  first  record  of  BP  was  obtained  before  treatments  for 
HF on the hospital floor in a supine position, and BP at dis-
charge was measured in a supine position after resting for at 
least  10  minutes.  SBP  was  categorized  into  four  groups 
(quartile at admission: < 105, 105–119, 120–134 and ≥ 135 
mmHg) for risk estimation. 

Clinical  variables  at  admission  (the  first  record  during 
hospitalization) and at discharge (the last record during hos-
pitalization) included demographic characteristics (age, gen-
der and body mass index), length of hospitalization, NYHA 
classification,  SBP,  DBP,  heart  rate,  comorbidities  (coro-
nary  heart  disease,  hypertension,  atrial  fibrillation/flutter, 

diabetes mellitus, dilated cardiomyopathy, anemia, cerebro-
vascular  accident,  myocardial  infarction  and  pulmonary 
artery hypertension), laboratory data (hemoglobin, total pro-
tein, albumin, potassium, sodium, creatinine, blood urea 
nitrogen,  uric  acid,  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate 
(eGFR),  triglycerides,  total  cholesterol,  high-density  lipo-
protein and low-density lipoprotein), LVEF and medications 
(angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitor  (ACEI),  angio-
tensin receptor blocker (ARB), spironolactone, loop diuret-
ics,  digoxin,  calcium  channel  blockers,  statins  and  war-
farin). 

Adverse  events  with  respect  to  all-cause  death,  cardio-
vascular  (CV)  death,  and  heart  transplantation  were  ascer-
tained  every  three  months  via  electronic  hospital  record 
follow-up or conversation with patients or their families by 
telephone.  The  primary  outcome  of  our  study  was  a  com-
posite of CV death and heart transplantation. The secondary 
outcome  was  a  composite  of  all-cause  death  and  heart 
transplantation. CV death was defined as progressive heart 
failure death (progressive deterioration of HF in the absence 
of  other  causes),  sudden  death  (unexpected  and  witnessed 
death in a stable patient without evidence of a special cause 
of  death),  death  due  to  myocardial  infarction  or  stroke,  or 
other  CV  death  (such  as  mortal  complications  of  cardiac 
surgery, rupture of an aneurysm, pulmonary embolism, aor-
tic dissection, etc.).   

To  categorize  the  potential  effects  of  different  doses  of 
ACEIs/ARBs, beta blockers and loop diuretics on the renin- 
angiotensin-aldosterone system that would further affect the 
outcomes, we adjusted for some variables. Doses of ACEIs, 
ARBs and beta blockers were divided into four quartiles: 0, 
1%–49%,  50%–99%,  and  ≥  100%  of  the  target  dose.[16,17] 
Loop diuretics were converted to the furosemide-equivalent 
dose:[18] 1  mg of oral  torsemide  was  considered  equivalent 
to  2  mg  of  oral  furosemide,  and  1  mg  of  oral  bumetanide 
was considered equivalent to 40 mg of oral furosemide. To 
evaluate the progression of heart failure, we introduced the 
variable EF, which was defined as the difference between 
LVEF at discharge and LVEF at admission.   

2.3    Statistical analyses 

Continuous data are presented as median with interquar-
tile range (IQR) and were compared by the Mann-Whitney 
U test or Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical data are presented 
as percentages and were analyzed using the chi-square test 
or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Comparisons were also 
made between patients with and without follow-up informa-
tion. 

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine cumu-
lative probabilities of endpoints from the time of discharge

throughout  the  follow-up  period.  Cumulative  event  rates 
were compared by the log-rank test. 

We  first  examined  the  association  of  SBP  at  admission 
and outcomes in the total cohort. To explore the relationship 
between  admission  SBP  (used  as  quartiles)  and  outcomes, 
variables at admission that had a P value < 0.05 in univari-
ate  Cox  proportional-hazards  analyses  were  introduced  as 
covariates in a multivariate model with a stepwise forward 
method (four covariates, namely, the doses of ACEIs/ARBs, 
beta blockers, and spironolactone and EF, were forced into 
in  the  final  models).  The  adjusted  hazard  ratios  (HRs)  for 
each  category  of  SBP  were  estimated  in  reference  to  the 
lowest quartile of SBP (< 105 mmHg). To examine the po-
tential  nonlinear  relationship  between  SBP  and  outcomes, 
restricted cubic spline analyses were also used based on the 
same covariables in the multivariate Cox model. The incor-
porated knots used in the model were the 5th, 50th and 95th 
percentiles  of  SBP  (at  90,  118,  153  mmHg  for  admission 
SBP and at 90, 110 and 130 mmHg for discharge SBP, re-
spectively).  The  SBP  level  with  the  lowest  risk  of  events 
was  used  as  the  reference  in  the  restricted  cubic  spline 
model. The above-described method was repeated to evalu-
ate  the  association  of  SBP  at  discharge  and  outcomes  (co-
variates were those at discharge). In addition, we used SBP 
at admission as a covariate in all final models of discharge 
SBP.  HRs  are  presented  with  95%  confidence  intervals 
(CIs). We  also  explored  the  relationship  between  SBP  and 
outcomes  in  subgroups.  All  statistical  analyses  were  per-
formed using SPSS version 22 and R 3.4. 

3    Results 

A  total  of  2144  patients  fulfilled  the  inclusion  criteria. 
After excluding those patients who had no follow-up data (n 
= 139), a total of 2005 patients were included in our analy-
ses. The median age was 59 years (IQR: 48–69 years), and 
69.9% were male. Their characteristics were compared with 
those  of  the  patients  who  had  no  follow-up  data.  Patients 
without  follow-up  data  were  more  likely  to  have  cerebro-
vascular accidents, worse renal function (reflected by blood 
urea nitrogen and eGFR), worse heart function (reflected by 
LVEF  and  NYHA  classification),  and  lower  SBP  at  dis-
charge (Supplement Table 1).   

3.1    SBP at admission and patient characteristics 

The characteristics of the patients categorized by admis-
sion SBP are listed in Table 1. Patients with higher admis-
sion SBP were older and were more likely to have coronary 
heart  disease,  hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus  and  cere-
brovascular accidents but less likely to have dilated cardio-

myopathy  or  pulmonary  artery  hypertension.  They  were 
also less likely to suffer from hyponatremia, had lower lev-
els of blood urea nitrogen and uric acid levels, and had bet-
ter  heart  function  on  admission.  EF  was  not  significantly 
different  across  the  SBP  categories.  Patients  with  higher 
SBP were more likely to use higher doses of ACEIs/ARBs, 
calcium  channel  blockers  and  statins.  However,  they  were 
less  likely  to  be  prescribed  beta  blockers,  spironolactone, 
loop diuretics and digoxin. Most patients had experienced a 
process of SBP decline or maintenance, except for those in 
the lowest quartile. 

3.2    SBP at discharge and patient characteristics 

The  characteristics  of  the  patients  categorized  by  dis-
charge SBP are shown in Table 2. Patients with higher SBP 
at  discharge  were  also  older  and  were  more  likely  to  have 
coronary  heart  disease,  hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus  and 
cerebrovascular  accidents  but  less  likely  to  have  dilated 
cardiomyopathy. They were also less likely to have hypona-
tremia.  However,  they  experienced  more  anemia  at  dis-
charge. Patients with higher discharge SBP also had higher 
BMI,  worse  renal  function  (reflected  by  creatinine,  blood 
urea nitrogen and eGFR) and better heart function (reflected 
by  LVEF  and  NYHA  classification)  on  admission.  They 
were more likely to use a higher dose of ACEI/ARB but less 
likely to be prescribed spironolactone. 

3.3    Relationship between SBPs and outcomes 

During the follow-up period, 837 patients had reached an 
endpoint, of whom  778 had died  (709 were  due  to  cardio-
vascular reasons), and 59 had undergone heart transplanta-
tion. The median follow-up time of our patient cohort was 
48.4  months  (interquartile  range  20.9–72.4  months).  The 
unadjusted survival curves for patients by SBP quartile are 
shown in Figure 1. 

In univariate Cox proportional-hazards analyses for SBP 
at admission, patients in the highest quartile of SBP (≥ 135 
mmHg) had a lower risk of CV death/heart transplantation 
(HR =  0.452, 95%  CI: 0.3660.559,  P  < 0.001)  compared 
with  SBP  <  105  mmHg,  and  the  survival  of  patients  with 
SBP  from  105  to  134  mmHg  was  between  the  two  (105– 
119 mmHg, HR = 0.656, 95% CI: 0.548–0.786, P < 0.001; 
120–134  mmHg  HR  =  0.481,  95%  CI:  0.395–0.586,  P  < 
0.001). According to the multivariate Cox model, compared 
with  SBP  <  105  mmHg,  higher  SBP  was  also  associated 
with  better  long-term  primary  outcome  (105–119  mmHg, 
HR  =  0.764,  95%  CI:  0.634–0.921,  P  =  0.005;  120–134 
mmHg,  HR  =  0.658,  95%  CI:  0.532–0.813,  P  <  0.001;  ≥ 
135 mmHg, HR = 0.657, 95% CI: 0.515–0.837; P = 0.001).

The  results  of  survival  analyses  for  SBP  at  discharge 
were  dramatically  different.  In  univariate  Cox  analyses, 
patients  in  the highest quartile  of  SBP (≥ 135  mmHg) had   
a lower risk of CV death and transplantation compared with 
SBP < 105 mmHg (HR = 0.688, 95% CI: 0.485–0.976, P = 
0.036).  However,  the  multivariate  Cox  model  showed  that 
these patients all had similar primary outcomes (HR = 0.969,   
95% CI: 0.667–1.407, P = 0.867). This remained unchanged 

even after adjusting admission SBP (HR = 1.235, 95% CI: 
0.835–1.826,  P  =  0.291).  Detailed  results  of  multivariate 
analyses (CV death/heart transplantation or all-cause death/ 
heart transplantation) are shown in Tables 3 & 4. 

Restricted  cubic  spline  graphical  representations  of  the 
relationship  between SBP and  the  outcomes  of  interest  are 
shown in Figure 2. There was a reverse J-curve relationship 
between admission SBP and outcomes. Patients whose SBP

4    Discussion 

Our study was the first to use a hospitalized HF cohort to 
explore  the  association  of  SBP  measured  at  different  time 
points (at admission and at discharge) with long-term post-
discharge mortality. Doses of ACEIs/ARBs and beta blockers   
were used as covariates in multivariate analyses. The char-
acteristics  of  our  cohort were  different  across  SBP  catego-

ries.  In  spite  of  better  heart  function  and  higher  doses  of   
ACEIs/ARBs,  patients  with  higher  SBP  at  admission  suf-
fered  from  more  coronary heart disease,  hypertension,  dia-
betes  mellitus  and  cerebrovascular  accidents.  Consistent 
with  previous  studies,  our  study  also  showed  that  HF  pa-
tients  with  higher  SBP  at  admission  had  better  outcomes. 
However, when we assessed the effect of SBP at discharge, 
we  found  dramatically  different  results  from  the  results  of

admission SBP.  Although patients with higher  SBP  at dis-
charge were less likely to have dilated cardiomyopathy and 
more  likely  to  have  better  heart  function  and  to  receive 
higher  doses  of  ACEIs/ARBs,  they  tended  to  have  higher 
rates of poor renal function, coronary heart disease, hyper-
tension,  diabetes  mellitus  and  cerebrovascular  accidents. 
After  multivariate  adjustment,  we  found  that  patients  with 
SBP ≥ 135 mmHg shared a similar risk of adverse outcomes 
as  patients  with  SBP  <  105  mmHg  (CV  death/heart  trans-
plantation  HR  =  0.969,  P  =  0.867;  all-cause  death/heart 
transplantation  HR  =  1.235,  P  =  0.291).  Restricted  cubic 
spline  analyses  also  showed  that  patients  with  discharge 
SBP < 101 mmHg and ≥ 130 mmHg had higher risks of CV 
death and heart transplantation. 

Like  hypertension,[1,2]  high-normal  SBP  (130–139   

mmHg)[19]  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  cardio-
vascular disease (including HF). Previous clinical trials[3,20,21] 
have shown that anti-hypertensive treatments can reduce the 
risk of HF.  A recent  meta-analysis[5]  with stringent  criteria 
of  including  RCTs  with  no  baseline  heart  failure  also 
showed  a  large  and  highly  significant  reduction  of  “new- 
onset” heart failure after blood pressure lowering. Moreover, 
the  results  from  the  Systolic  Blood  Pressure  Intervention 
Trial  (SPRINT)[4]  demonstrated  that  intensive  treatment 
(SBP  less  than  120  mmHg)  in  a  non-diabetic  population 
reduced the risk of developing heart failure.   

However, in patients who have suffered from HF, the ef-
fect of SBP on outcomes remains unclear. The time points 
of SBP measurement are also different across prior studies. 
Real-world evidence showed that low SBP at admission was 
associated  with  in-hospital  death.[22,23]  However,  the  long- 
term  relationship  between  SBP  and  mortality  is  controver-
sial. In a group of incident HF patients,[8] the highest quartile 
of baseline SBP was associated with a higher rate of adverse 
events (composite  of  stroke, major bleeding  or death), and 
restricted cubic spline analysis indicated a slightly U-shaped 
association  for  SBP  regarding  death.  OPTIMIZE-HF[9] 
found that lower SBP at admission was an independent pre-
dictor  of  postdischarge  mortality  in  patients  with  HF.  The 
results  of  other  studies[10–14]  also  showed  that  higher  base-
line  SBP  was  associated  with  better  outcomes.  Recently, 
Lee,  et  al.[15]  discovered  that  the  relationship  between 
on-treatment  SBP  and  all-cause  mortality  followed  a  re-
versed  J-curve  relationship,  and  SBP  <  100  mmHg  at  dis-
charge  and  during  follow-up  were  associated  with  worse 
survival  in  HF  patients.  However,  all  these  studies  did  not 
adjust  for  the  doses  of  ACEIs/ARBs  and  beta  blockers, 
which  would  affect  SBP  and  heart  function  at  the  same 
time. 

It is recommended by the current guidelines of the Euro-

pean Society of Cardiology[16] to treat heart failure patients 
with  reduced  EF  with  the  maximum  tolerated  doses  of 
ACEIs/ARBs and beta blockers. Studies showed the superi-
ority  of  higher  doses  of  ACEIs/ARBs  and  beta  blockers 
compared  with  lower  doses.[24–26]  Physicians  may  be  more 
aggressive in using ACEIs/ARBs and beta blockers, which 
also  have  anti-hypertensive  effects  in  patients  with  higher 
blood  pressure.  In  addition,  patients  with  higher  SBP  may 
better  tolerate  higher  doses  of  these  agents,  which  could 
improve  their prognosis.  Therefore,  in  addition  to  the high 
rate  of  use  of  ACEIs/ARBs  and  beta  blockers,  different 
doses of these agents may mask the effect of SBP on mor-
tality in HF patients, especially in those with high SBP. No-
tably,  ACEIs/ARBs  and  beta  blockers  were  introduced  in 
previous  studies  as  binary  variables.  Previous  studies  ig-
nored  the  importance  of  the  doses  of  these  agents,  which 
might be a potential confounder between SBP and prognosis 
in heart failure. We were the first to introduce ACEIs/ARBs 
and beta blockers as dose-based covariates into a multivari-
ate  Cox  model,  and  we  found  a  U-shaped  association  be-
tween discharge SBP and CV mortality/heart transplantation, 
which was  different from  the reverse  J-shaped relationship 
between admission SBP and outcomes. 

The  mechanism  of  these  opposite  relationships  between 
the  different  SBPs  and  mortality  and  whether  these  rela-
tionships  were  consequences  or  etiological  factors  for  out-
comes are unclear. Higher SBP at admission may be related 
to  greater  short-term  “cardiovascular  reserve”.  This  makes 
such patients able to receive ACEIs/ARBs or beta blockers 
and tolerate higher doses of these drugs. The effect of these 
treatments  and  the  better  heart  function  drive  an  improved 
prognosis. In contrast, after adjustment for variables at dis-
charge, there was a U-shaped association between discharge 
SBP and outcomes. It was independent of patient character-
istics and was consistent in subgroup analyses. This meant 
that even high-normal SBP at discharge may also be associ-
ated with an increased risk of postdischarge mortality in HF 
patients.  Our  result  was  consistent  with  the  results  of  a 
postanalysis  of  the  COMET  (Carvedilol  Or  Metoprolol 
European Trial) study.[27] In multivariable analysis, the SBP 
at  four  months  played  a  more  important  role  in  prognosis 
than baseline SBP, and patients with SBP > 140 mmHg had 
a similar risk of mortality as those with SBP < 110 mmHg. 
This  phenomenon  may  be  due  to  heavy  afterload  on  the 
heart over a long period of time. Notably, we found that the 
SBP  of  most  patients  in  the  highest  quartile  at  admission 
declined to 105–134 mmHg (79.8%) at discharge from the 
hospital, and only 12.4% stayed at ≥ 135 mmHg. This was 
consistent  with  the  data  of  OPTIMIZE-HF,[9]  where  the 
mean SBP at discharge was 128 mmHg in the third admis-

sion SBP quartile (140–161 mmHg) and 138 mmHg in the 
highest quartile (> 161 mmHg). Obviously, the majority of 
patients  with  high  SBP  at  admission  eventually  had  their 
SBP  decline  to  a  normal  range.  This  may  explain  the  dif-
ferent  associations  with  outcomes  between  high  admission 
SBP and high discharge SBP.   

Our  study  provides  new  insights  into  the  relationship 
between SBP and mortality in HF patients. First, the SBP at 
admission  usually  reflects  the  “cardiovascular  reserve”  in 
the decompensated phase (the higher SBP at admission, the 
greater  “cardiovascular  reserve”).  This  explains  why  HF 
patients with higher SBP at admission have a better prognosis.   
Second,  HF  patients  with  uncontrolled  hypertension  at 
discharge (in our study SBP ≥ 135 mmHg) also had a simi-
lar risk of mortality as those with the lowest quartile SBP (in 
our study SBP < 105 mmHg). In patients with systolic dys-
function  and/or  heart  failure,  higher  SBP  has  been  associ-
ated with higher stroke risk.[14] The harm of hypertension in 
HF patients was likely to be immerged into those with high 
admission  SBP  because  most  of  these  patients  had  normal 
SBP at discharge (in our study SBP 105–134 mmHg).   

We should be aware of the necessity of anti-hypertension 
treatment  in  HF  patients  during  hospitalization  and  after 
discharge from the hospital. The proposed anti-hypertension 
strategy  was  geared  toward  preserving  systolic  function  in 
HFrEF  or  toward  improving  diastolic  dysfunction  in  heart 
failure  with  preserved  ejection  fraction  (HFpEF)  and  heart 
failure with mid-range reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). 
ACEIs/ARBs,  beta  blockers,  angiotensin  receptor–neprily-
sin inhibitors, MRAs and diuretics are the first-line agents to 
control  blood  pressure  in  HFrEF.[7]  Nondihydropyridine 
CCBs  and  moxonidine  should  be  avoided  in  patients  with 
HFrEF. If blood pressure was not controlled with an ACEI/ 
ARB,  a  beta  blocker,  an  MRA  and  a  diuretic,  then  hydra-
lazine  and  amlodipine  (or  felodipine)  are  recommended 
agents  that  have  been  shown  to  be  safe  in  HFrEF.[16]  Cir-
cumstantial evidence has shown that treating hypertension is 
important in HFmrEF/HFpEF.[16] ACEIs/ARBs, MRAs and 
diuretics all appear to be appropriate agents, but beta block-
ers might be less effective in reducing SBP.[16] Patients with 
HFrEF  and  hypertension  should  attain  a  blood  pressure  of 
less than 130/80 mmHg, and SBP of less than 130 mmHg 
was  a  recommend  for  patients  with  HFpEF  and  persistent 
hypertension.[7]   

Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. 
First, this was a single-center, retrospective study, and many 
unmeasured variables could have had residual confounding 
bias.  Second,  the  exclusion  of  those  patients  without  fol-
low-up data might have affected our results. Third, despite 
adjustment of the doses of ACEIs/ARBs and beta blockers, 

the doses of these agents might change after discharge, and 
the  SBP  during  follow-up  could  vary  as  the  treatment  and 
patient condition change. Additionally, the BP measurement 
was  not  strictly  measured  at  standardized  time  intervals), 
and this might have affected the results of our study. Last, 
the results of our study were based on hospitalized patients 
with  decompensated  HF,  and  they  might  not  be  generaliz-
able  to  ambulatory  patients  who  manifest  with  acute  de-
compensation or chronic HF with good titration of ACEIs/ 
ARBs and beta blockers. 

In conclusion, SBP measured at different time points (at 
admission and at discharge) has different associations with 
postdischarge  outcomes.  Lower  but  not  higher  SBP  at  ad-
mission is associated with more cardiovascular deaths/heart 
transplantations (a reverse J-shaped curve). In contrast, there 
is  a  U-shaped association between discharge  SBP  and  car-
diovascular deaths/heart transplantations. Patients with SBP 
≥  135  mmHg  have  a  similar  risk  of  cardiovascular  death/ 
heart  transplantation  as patients whose SBP < 105  mmHg. 
Blood pressure  management  remains  an  important  issue  to 
be addressed, and further studies are needed to evaluate the 
relationship  among  blood  pressure,  doses  of  drugs  that 
would reduce blood pressure but improve the prognosis, and 
outcomes in HF patients.
