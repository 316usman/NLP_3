Liver transplantation is now the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage liver
disease.1–3 Since the introduction of the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine in 1978,4
organ replacement has gained acceptance as the only intervention that can cure this
relentless, chronic process and offer the chance of complete rehabilitation.

One-year survival rates of 70% or better have been reported for many groups of patients.5,6
The majority can look forward to long, productive lives. The operation now can be
recommended to persons formerly thought to be at prohibitively high risk because of their
particular disease, prior abdominal surgery, extreme youth, or advanced age. The youngest
and oldest recipients of successful transplants at our institutions were 3½ weeks and 76
years old.

Refinements in surgical technique have contributed to these improved results, particularly
the introduction of the venovenous bypass,7 improvements in biliary tract reconstruction,8
and the development of methods for multiple organ procurement.9–11 For a description of
how the operations on donor and recipient are done, see “Current surgical technique,” page
78.

PATIENT EVALUATION

Even though most patients are referred to a transplant center with an established diagnosis,
each person is thoroughly evaluated to assess suitability and fitness for operation. We take a
careful history, paying special attention to alcohol and drug abuse, blood-product
transfusions, concomitant illnesses, previous operations, medications, and exposure to
toxins. During the physical examination, we look for xanthomas and Kayser-Fleischer rings,
which are associated with primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson’s disease, respectively.

Mental status is assessed. We grade encephalopathy, according to its severity (Table 1), and
try to identify precipitating causes, such as dehydration, infection, or gastrointestinal (GI)
bleeding. More severe cases are managed in the intensive care unit; endotracheal intubation
is sometimes necessary to prevent aspiration. Patients with encephalopathy are given
neomycin and lactulose.

Routine blood tests include CBC, full coagulation profile, liver-function tests, measures of
serum electrolytes and glucose, and renal-function tests. Abnormalities in the coagulation
profile should be corrected before any invasive procedures are done. Renal-function
abnormalities are investigated, in order to distinguish among the hepatorenal syndrome,

simple dehydration (due to chronic diuretic therapy and ascites), and intrinsic renal disease.
Morbidity and mortality are increased in patients who develop renal failure during the
posttransplant period. Patients who have end-stage liver disease and irreversible renal failure
can be managed successfully with combined liver-kidney transplantation.12

We have found the indocyanine clearance study useful in assessing residual liver function
and in determining the urgency of a patient’s need for a transplant. After an initial loading
dose of 0.5 mg/kg, indocyanine retention is measured at five-minute intervals. A retention of
5% or greater at 20 minutes constitutes evidence of liver disease; values greater than 30% or
50% indicate significant or very severe liver disease, respectively.

Upper-GI endoscopy is performed to detect esophageal varices. Persons who have a history
of variceal bleeding or have severe varices at endoscopy are treated with injection
sclerotherapy. Colonoscopy may be performed to detect other pathologic conditions, such as
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or neoplasia in patients with primary sclerosing
cholangitis.

Ultrasound and Doppler studies determine the patency of the portal vein, hepatic artery,
hepatic veins, and vena cava. Angiography is reserved for patients whose portal veins cannot
be visualized by noninvasive means and for those with previous portosystemic venous
shunts; it is important to assess the status of both the shunt and the portal vein.

A thrombosed portal vein (Figure 1), once an absolute contraindication to liver
transplantation, is now only a relative contraindication. It is often possible either to perform
a thrombectomy on the recipient portal vein, to anastomose the donor portal vein, or to
interpose a graft of donor iliac vein at the confluence of the recipient mesenteric and splenic
veins.13

The transplant center’s social service department evaluates all candidates. Psychiatric
assessment and treatment are sometimes sought for patients with psychosocial problems.
The most frequent reasons for referral are substance abuse and compliance problems.

Once we have determined that a patient needs a liver transplant, we evaluate pulmonary,
cardiac, and renal status in order to gauge surgical risk and to prepare for the operation. We

also consider other risk factors—previous abdominal or portosystemic shunt surgery, active
infection, and advanced age. Although risk does increase with age, transplantation can
succeed with carefully selected patients aged 70 or more.14 The oldest patient in our series, a
76-year-old woman with primary biliary cirrhosis, is doing extremely well more than 18
months after operation.

The absolute contraindications to liver transplantation are malignant disease outside the
liver, a patient’s inability to accept or understand the procedure, symptomatic acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome, and other systemic diseases or debilitating complications that
transplantation cannot reverse. Indications for early hepatic transplantation include major GI
bleeding, repeated bouts of encephalopathy, progressive neuropathy, refractory ascites, a
recent precipitous deterioration in liver function, rapid progression of bone disease, and
severe wasting.

The patient’s weight, height, ABO blood group, and liver volume as assessed by ultrasound
or computed tomography (CT) (Figure 2) aid in donor-recipient matching.15 The ultrasound
study and CT are also useful means of detecting hepatic tumors and excluding extrahepatic
extension.

The results of the evaluation are discussed at a weekly conference attended by the transplant
surgeons, hepatologists, nurse coordinators, social workers, anesthesiologists, radiologists,
pathologists, critical-care physicians, psychiatrists, and sometimes other specialists. At this
meeting, we assess the urgency of the patient’s need for a transplant, on the basis of clinical
findings and performance status, as described in Table 2.

While awaiting a donor, patients who can be managed at home return to the care of their
private physicians, maintaining close communication with the clinic through an assigned
nurse coordinator. Others find local accommodations and visit the clinic once or twice a
week. Persons in urgent need of transplantation remain in the hospital until a donor becomes
available, to ensure that they are in the best possible condition at the time of operation.

INDICATIONS FOR TRANSPLANTATION

Between March 1980, when cyclosporine-corticosteroid therapy was introduced, and July
1987, 666 adults and 334 children underwent liver transplantation at programs in Denver
and Pittsburgh, and at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. In adults, the most
common indications for transplantation were postnecrotic cirrhosis, primary biliary
cirrhosis, and sclerosing cholangitis; in children, they were biliary atresia, inborn errors of
metabolism, and cirrhosis (Figure 3). The one- and five-year actuarial survival rates for
these 1,000 patients were 71.2% and 62.6%, respectively.16 Actuarial survival rates by
reason for operation appear in Figure 4.

Postnecrotic cirrhosis

Most patients with cirrhosis, the most common indication for liver transplantation, have
chronic active hepatitis. Some have cryptogenic cirrhosis, and an increasing number have
Laënnec’s cirrhosis.

After transplantation, disease often recurs in persons whose earlier serologic tests were
positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Some patients have undergone
retransplantation after recurrence, but the risk of a second recurrence is high. We are
currently evaluating whether α-interferon, administered during the perioperative period to
HBsAg-positive patients and the donor livers, will reduce the recurrence rate.

Because of general ill-health, patients with Laënnec’s cirrhosis are a high-risk group, and
alcoholic recidivism is a concern. However, transplantation should be offered to carefully
selected patients who have this condition. Experience with our first 41 such individuals
suggests that their chances of survival and rehabilitation are as good as those of patients who
have nonalcoholic cirrhosis.16

Primary biliary cirrhosis

An uncommon disease that most often affects middle-aged women, primary biliary cirrhosis
is the second leading indication for transplantation in adults. It is characterized by jaundice,
pruritus, hepatomegaly, easy fatigability, and bone disease of varying severity. Although its
cause is unknown, it is believed to be an autoimmune disease; antimitochondrial antibodies
are found in over 90% of patients. Thyroiditis, lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, renal
tubular acidosis, and rheumatoid arthritis are likely concomitant illnesses.

Asymptomatic patients have an excellent life expectancy, and many never develop clinically
significant organ damage.17 For those who do, medical therapy—D-penicillamine,
chlorambucil, colchicine, corticosteroids, azathioprine, or cyclosporine—has been
advocated, but there is little evidence that these agents are effective.18 Recent trials with D-
penicillamine failed to demonstrate a significant benefit.19–21 Once the disease has
progressed to an advanced stage, with jaundice and ascites, liver transplantation is the
treatment of choice. Since advanced age, a debilitated state, and disabling bone disease can
complicate postoperative recovery, referral for transplantation should not be delayed.

Sclerosing cholangitis

Most common in young men, sclerosing cholangitis frequently occurs in association with
other disorders, especially IBD. The incidence of coexisting cholangiocarcinoma has been
reported to be about 10%.22 Clinical findings suggesting such a carcinoma include an
exceedingly high bilirubin, recent deterioration in liver function, a long history of sclerosing
cholangitis, and an elevated level of carcinoembryonic antigen. However, as these findings
may be absent, everyone with sclerosing cholangitis should undergo cholangiography and
brush biopsy of suspicious lesions.

The results of transplantation in patients with cholangiocarcinoma have been poor; these
individuals should be referred for radiotherapy. We are presently considering preoperative
radiotherapy for patients with small, early bile duct cancers, to determine whether such
treatment reduces the incidence of tumor recurrence.

Sclerosing cholangitis is an incurable disease. Previous attempts at surgical biliary diversion
and hilar reconstruction usually complicate transplantation. Such operations should be
avoided except in highly selected patients with well-defined, localized extrahepatic lesions.
Operation for associated IBD is best deferred until three to six months after liver
transplantation.

Liver tumors

Transplantation should be considered for patients with advanced hepatic malignancy and
those who have benign tumors that cannot be removed by conventional subtotal resections.
Types of tumors for which patients have undergone liver transplantation include
hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hemangioendothelioma, neuroendocrine
tumors, and multiple adenoma. One patient whose liver had been almost entirely replaced by
lymphangioma received a transplant.23

Most patients with tumors are excellent candidates for operation, since portal hypertension
and its complications are usually not present. Early survival after transplantation has been
good, but long-term survival has been poor because tumors may recur fairly soon after
transplantation.

Patients with a hepatic malignancy must be examined thoroughly to determine that the
tumor does not extend beyond the confines of the liver. Often, the final decision must be
made at surgery. If a suitable donor becomes available, the surgeon does an exploratory
operation, proceeding to transplantation only if there is no evidence of extrahepatic tumor
spread.

In general, the survival rate after transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma has been poor;
however, there are exceptions. Patients who receive transplantation for end-stage liver
disease and are found to have an incidental primary hepatic tumor have the same survival
rate as do others with the same original disease, and their tumors have not recurred.

The fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma tends to occur in younger patients and
is less aggressive than other malignant lesions. Although tumor generally recurs, palliation
for two or more years can be achieved in many patients. Even after recurrence, the quality of
life may be good for a prolonged period, which is not the case when other malignancies
recur. Liver transplantation for hemangioendothelioma offers similarly favorable results.24

Conventional adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been used in combination with
liver transplantation in an effort to improve survival, but additional follow-up is needed to
evaluate their success. Furthermore, immunosuppressive agents given during the
posttransplant period may accelerate the growth of extrahepatic nests of malignant cells that
were not detected at the time of transplantation. Improved results may have to await the
advent of more selective methods of immunosuppression.

Biliary atresia

Nearly all infants and children who receive transplantation for biliary atresia have had a
previous operation, usually a portoenterostomy (Kasai procedure). Prior operation in the
right upper quadrant, particularly in the hepatic hilum, makes transplantation much more
difficult and increases postoperative morbidity. Although a well-timed and properly
performed portoenterostomy can be useful, we advise restraint rather than liberal use of this
procedure, especially in patients with established cirrhosis. Replacement of the liver is the
treatment of choice for biliary atresia, although the limited availability of very small
pediatric donors continues to be a major problem.

Inborn errors of metabolism

Most patients with inborn errors of metabolism are in good health otherwise, and few have
had previous upper-abdominal surgery. Thus, they are good candidates for transplantation.
The one-year survival rate is excellent, and no deaths have occurred beyond that point.

α-1-Antitrypsin deficiency and Wilson’s disease are two metabolic diseases that
transplantation can cure. The former causes a progressive macronodular cirrhosis and
obstructive pulmonary disease; the latter is associated with reduced copper excretion,
decreased serum ceruloplasmin, and excessive deposition of copper in the liver and brain.
Hereditary tyrosinemia, which causes progressive cirrhosis and increases the risk of
hepatocellular cancer, is another indication for operation. Transplantation has also been
performed in patients with glycogen storage disease, hemochromatosis, and familial
hypercholesterolemia.

Budd-Chiari syndrome

Page 6

Some patients given transplants because of Budd-Chiari syndrome require extensive
thrombectomy of the portal vein and vena cava, and all of them must be maintained on
permanent anticoagulation after operation. If anticoagulation is interrupted even briefly,
thrombosis, possibly fatal, may recur.

CURRENT SURGICAL TECHNIQUE
Operation to remove the liver from a donor is performed through a complete midline
incision from the suprasternal notch to the pubis. For the transplant recipient, a bilateral
subcostal incision with a superior midline T extension is almost always used. It should
not be necessary to enter the chest.

Standard approach to donor

The standard technique is first to divide the falciform, left triangular, and gastrohepatic
ligaments9 and then to ligate and divide the branches of the celiac trunk, including the
right gastric, gastroduodenal, splenic, and left gastric arteries. The common bile duct is
divided and the gallbladder flushed out. The portal vein is skeletonized and the splenic
vein cannulated. The supraceliac aorta is encircled for later cross-clamping. Next, the
distal aorta is ligated and cannulated. The superior mesenteric artery is ligated and
divided, the aorta cross-clamped, and ice-cold Ringer’s solution rapidly infused through
the splenic (portal) vein and the aorta. Infusion of preservation solution follows.

Once the liver has become very cold, it is removed, along with a large cuff of diaphragm
around the suprahepatic vena cava and over the bare area of the liver. The infrahepatic
vena cava is divided just above the renal veins. The celiac trunk is removed, with a cuff
of aorta. This technique is slightly modified when vascular anomalies are found.25,26

New approach

Recently, a method that entails virtually no preliminary dissection of the liver has been
used.10,11 The inferior mesenteric vein and distal aorta are ligated and cannulated. The
supraceliac aorta is cross-clamped, and the ice-cold infusion through the inferior
mesenteric vein and aorta begun. When the liver is thoroughly cooled, working in a
bloodless field without risk of inadvertent compromise of blood flow, the surgeon ligates
and divides the hilar structures and removes the organ as described above.

In both methods, the final dissection and preparation for anastomosis of the vena cava
and the hilar structures is performed on the back table. These methods allow the safe
removal of multiple organs (heart or heart-lung, kidney, liver, pancreas) in various
combinations, while maintaining excellent function.

Recipient operation

Once the abdomen is entered, the structures of the hepatic hilum are skeletonized, and the
hepatic artery and common bile duct are ligated and divided. A pump-driven venovenous
bypass system without recipient heparinization is used almost routinely in adults and
children over 30 pounds.7 Cannulae for the bypass are placed into the portal, femoral,
and axillary veins. With the patient on bypass, the coronary and triangular ligaments are
taken down and the vena cava is dissected to complete the hepatectomy.

The venovenous bypass allows the surgeon sufficient time to close the raw surfaces
created during the hepatectomy. It also converts a crisis environment during the
anhepatic phase of the operation into one that is easily controlled, and it has reduced
intraoperative bleeding, postrevascularization pulmonary edema and cardiac standstill,
and postoperative renal and gastrointestinal dysfunction.

Vascular cuffs are fashioned and the upper and lower caval anastomoses performed.
Alter portal anastomosis, the liver is reperfused. The bypass cannulae are removed and
hemostasis secured. Revascularization of the liver is completed with the arterial
anastomosis. If the recipient hepatic artery is inadequate, an iliac artery graft is
interposed between the donor hepatic artery and the infrarenal aorta, through a tunnel
created in an avascular plane behind the pancreas and duodenum. Finally, the biliary tract
is restored, using either a duct-to-duct repair over a T-tube stent or a
choledochojejunostomy to a jejunal Roux-en-Y limb.

A LOOK AT THE FUTURE

Future advances in immunology, organ procurement and preservation, and surgical
technique can be expected to lead to additional improvements in survival and quality of life.
Progress in organ preservation will make more livers available for transplantation by
extending ischemia time and thus allowing harvesting at greater distances from the
transplant center. The recent development of a lactobionate-hydroxyethyl starch-based
preservation solution, by Belzer and associates at the University of Wisconsin, has already
made it possible to preserve organs for significantly increased lengths of time.27 In over 100
transplantations of donor livers preserved in this solution, we have found it to be superior to
conventional preservation methods.

Although cyclosporine-corticosteroid therapy deserves much of the credit for current high
survival rates after transplantation, further improvements in immunosuppressive therapy are
anticipated; the ultimate goal is donor-specific immunotherapy. The monoclonal antibody
OKT3, produced by Ortho Pharmaceuticals as Orthoclone OKT3, has proved highly
effective in reversing steroid-resistant rejections, but like other relatively nonspecific
immunosuppressives, it is associated with a significant incidence of opportunistic
infections.28 A recent symposium in Gothenburg, Sweden, introduced a new agent known as
FK506, which has been tested extensively in animals with promising results.29

FIGURE 1.
When a transplant candidate’s portal vein cannot be visualized on ultrasound or Doppler
examination, angiography is performed. At left, the venous phase of a splenic arteriogram
demonstrates confluence of the inferior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein with absence of
the portal vein (arrow). At right, the venous phase of a superior mesenteric arteriogram in
the same patient demonstrates absence of the superior mesenteric vein (arrow). Such
abnormalities can often be repaired by thrombectomy, anastomosis, or a graft at the time of
operation.

FIGURE 3.
Between March 1980 and July 1987, 666 adults and 334 children underwent liver
transplantation at programs in Denver, Pittsburgh, and Dallas. Among adults (left), cirrhosis
was the most common reason for transplantation; among children (right), biliary atresia.

FIGURE 4.
Since 1980, one- and five-year survival rates after transplantation have risen to 71.2% and
62.6%, respectively. Patients with HBsAg-negative cirrhosis, primary biliary cirrhosis,
biliary atresia, and inborn errors of metabolism have the best prognosis. Five-year rates for
patients with sclerosing cholangitis are not yet available, as the longest-surviving patients
received new livers four years ago. There have been no five-year survivors after
transplantation for nonfibrolamellar hepatoma.
