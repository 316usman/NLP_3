Abstract

Planets are expected to conclude their growth through a series of giant im-
pacts: energetic, global events that significantly alter planetary composition
and evolution. Computer models and theory have elucidated the diverse
outcomes of giant impacts in detail, improving our ability to interpret colli-
sion conditions from observations of their remnants. However, many open
questions remain, as even the formation of the Moon—a widely suspected
giant-impact product for which we have the most information—is still de-
bated. We review giant-impact theory, the diverse nature of giant-impact
outcomes, and the governing physical processes. We discuss the importance
of computer simulations, informed by experiments, for accurately modeling
the impact process. Finally, we outline how the application of probabil-
ity theory and computational advancements can assist in inferring collision
histories from observations, and we identify promising opportunities for
advancing giant-impact theory in the future.

■ Giant impacts exhibit diverse possible outcomes leading to changes in
planetary mass, composition, and thermal history depending on the
conditions.

■ Improvements to computer simulation methodologies and new labo-
ratory experiments provide critical insights into the detailed outcomes
of giant impacts.

■ When colliding planets are similar in size, they can merge or escape
one another with roughly equal probability, but with different effects
on their resulting masses, densities, and orbits.

1. INTRODUCTION

The last stage of planet formation is thought to have been marked by a period of mutual collisions,
called giant impacts (see the sidebar titled What Makes an Impact Giant?). For the Solar System,
these collisions have been proposed to involve Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos, eventually
resulting in a few terrestrial planets remaining in widely spaced, stable orbits (Figure 1). Because
of the similar size of the colliding bodies and the large range of their expected impact velocities
(up to tens of kilometers per second), giant impacts are global-scale, high-energy events that

WHAT MAKES AN IMPACT GIANT?

When impactors are small, their imprints generally resemble a bowl-shaped divot or a wide, flat impression, deemed
crater-forming or basin-forming events, qualifiers that depend on the outcome. When the impactor and target are
comparable, such as the Moon-forming impact or collisions in the asteroid belt, the common monikers are pairwise
accretion and similar-sized collisions; aside from gas giants, there is little distinction between the terms similar size
and similar mass. When the similarly sized colliding bodies are large and their interaction is dominated by gravity,
the term giant impacts is often employed. The terms similar-sized collisions and giant impacts are not based on
outcome as the results vary considerably under expected impact parameters. The exact transition from cratering to
giant impacts remains unclear.

surrounded by nebular gas and dust where early solids form. In the next stage, nebular gas begins to dissipate over (cid:24)2–3 million years
(Williams & Cieza 2011), and mass accumulates into fewer and larger bodies, forming planetary embryos. Next, the orbits of the
planetary embryos cross each other and lead to giant impacts such as that illustrated in the inset. After tens to hundreds of millions of
years of giant impacts, the terrestrial planets achieve a stable architecture (for a review, see Raymond & Morbidelli 2022) (see

can alter planetary compositions and atmospheres that planets inherited from nebular processes.
For example, primordial volatiles or atmospheres may be driven off by a giant impact, or mantle
materials can be stripped and ejected entirely. Magma oceans are also often a consequence of giant
impacts. Heat production in large fractions of the planets can influence geodynamic processes and
promote the outgassing of volatiles previously bound within planetary interiors. The consequences
of these effects on planetary habitability are not yet entirely understood.

Analytical work and computer simulations have revealed that giant-impact outcomes can vary
considerably depending on the impact conditions. In some scenarios, the colliding bodies merge
into a larger body, with minor amounts of material ejected in the process. For off-axis scenarios
at sufficient velocity, the bodies can graze each other and escape along deflected paths. Although
expected to be rare in Solar System formation, highly erosive outcomes are also possible, resulting
in destruction of the target and/or impactor depending on preimpact conditions. Crust and mantle
materials are ejected to varying degrees in all scenarios causing changes in composition. As an
important by-product, ejected debris can collide with other planets or contribute to the population
of small bodies such as moons and asteroids.

The diversity of giant-impact outcomes may be the cause of the wide array of planetary bulk
compositions observed in the Solar System and exoplanetary data. However, addressing this hy-
pothesis is challenging because different impact conditions can produce similar outcomes. For
example, several models of the Moon-forming giant impact can reproduce the bulk properties of
the Earth-Moon system with similar fidelity. Furthermore, different planetary systems can form
from the same initial conditions due in part to the chaotic nature of gravitational interactions. Un-
derstanding the diversity of giant-impact outcomes and incorporating them into models of planet
formation are critical steps to address competing hypotheses for the formation of Solar System
and exoplanetary bodies.

1.1. Basics of Giant-Impact Theory

Study of the giant-impact phenomenon started in the mid-twentieth century as part of the larger
debate on nebular theory and the coagulation of early Solar System solids (e.g., Schmidt 1958).
Analytical studies of the evolution of protoplanets before and after nebular gas dissipation showed
that collisions played a vital role in both stages. Without the presence of gas, two bodies generally
collide at a velocity (vcoll) larger than or equal to their mutual escape velocity,

where G is Newton’s gravitational constant, M is mass, and subscripts T and I indicate the target
and impactor, respectively (e.g., Gurevich & Lebedinsky 1950). An impact velocity of vcoll D vesc
is the result of gravitational forces between two bodies accelerating toward one another from an
infinite distance with no initial relative velocity (v1 D 0). It is derived by equating the impact

WHAT IS THE MOST PROBABLE COLLISION ANGLE ((cid:18)coll)?
The differential probability that a point-mass impactor will hit a massless spherical target at a distance x D RT
sin (cid:18) coll from its center is dP D 2(cid:25) xdx D 2(cid:25)R2
coll with a maximum at (cid:18) coll D 45° (Gilbert 1893). For
coll d(cid:18)
an undeformable target with mass, the gravitational cross section R, which represents the maximum distance of an
impactor’s undeflected path from the target that would result in impact, exceeds RT. From conservation of angular
momentum, x D RTvcoll=v1 sin (cid:18) coll yielding dP D 2(cid:25)xdx D 2(cid:25)R2
coll, and peaking at (cid:18) coll D
45° (Shoemaker 1962). The dP((cid:18) coll) / sin (2(cid:18) coll) proportionality is expected to hold for giant impacts, although
tidal distortions may complicate matters (Asphaug 2010).

and solving for velocity. Impact velocities at the mutual escape speed result in the accretion of
the impactor and target (e.g., Safronov 1964). During planet formation however, vcoll > vesc is
commonplace. This is due to the scattering of planetary bodies into more eccentric (more ellip-
tical) or inclined (tilted with respect to the paths of other bodies) orbits by gravitational forces,
increasing relative velocities. Colliding bodies thus are not generally in free fall (v1 D 0) but
have an additional contribution to their relative velocity (v1 > 0). This yields a collision velocity,
1, that often exceeds vesc. Material may be ejected as a result, leading to erosion

1.2. Diversity of Giant-Impact Outcomes

Early computer simulations of the giant-impact process led to the characterization of the outcomes
of collisions that occur beyond vesc and provided new potential pathways for the formation of
the Moon and Mercury. These studies also revealed that impact geometry plays a central role in
dictating the fate of any colliding pair [see the sidebar titled What Is the Most Probable Collision
Angle ((cid:18) coll)?].

1.2.1. Moon formation in off-axis collisions. From calculations of planet formation near 1 as-
tronomical unit (AU), Hartmann & Davis (1975) showed that giant impacts into proto-Earth at
collision velocities just above vesc would have been commonplace. They proposed that the Moon
coagulated from a silicate-rich disk around Earth generated by a large-scale collision, providing an
explanation for the paucity of volatile elements in Apollo samples. The colliding body was posited
to be roughly the mass of Mars—a truly giant impact. Furthermore, radiometric age dating of
Apollo lunar samples indicates that the oldest samples formed (cid:24)100 million years after the for-
mation of the Solar System (Tatsumoto & Rosholt 1970). This was broadly consistent with giant
impacts occurring after the nebular gas dissipated (Safronov 1964), (cid:24)2–3 million years into Solar
System formation (e.g., Williams & Cieza 2011). Accretion of the Moon from silicate materials
also provides a natural explanation for its small core, which accounts for about 10% of its mass
(Asphaug 2014).

The angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system has also served as a critical benchmark
for constraining the preimpact parameters of the Moon-forming impact. To form the proto-lunar
disk, debris must be ejected into bound and stable orbits (Cameron & Ward 1976). This is made
possible by collisions with sufficient angular momentum, which are predominantly dependent
on collision angle and velocity (neglecting preimpact rotation of the two bodies). At contact, the
specific angular momentum of the relative orbit is proportional to (RT C RI)vcoll sin (cid:18) coll, where
(cid:18) coll is the collision angle (Figure 2a). As such, simulations of the Moon-forming giant impact in-
volved off-axis collision geometries as a means of generating bound postimpact disks around Earth
((cid:18) coll k 0°) (e.g., Benz et al. 1986, Stevenson 1987, Cameron & Benz 1991, Cameron 2000).

d(cid:18) coll (Shoemaker 1962). Due to the sin (2(cid:18) coll) distribution, head-on ((cid:18) coll (cid:24) 0°) or glancing collisions ((cid:18) coll (cid:24) 90°) are much less likely
than moderately glancing geometries ((cid:18) coll (cid:24) 45°).

By examining the intermediate epochs of lengthy Moon formation calculations, it was dis-
covered that the impactor can graze the target, proceed along a gravitationally bound orbit,
and eventually be accreted onto the proto-Earth in a spiraling fashion (see Figure 3 and the
Supplemental Videos). This graze-and-merge process liberates debris that form the circum-
planetary disk from which the Moon can accrete and can occur even in relatively gentle scenarios
(vcoll < 1.1vesc). Refinements of the graze-and-merge formation of the Moon with a Mars-sized
impactor would result in the canonical model of Moon formation (Canup 2004). In alternative,
´Cuk & Stewart 2012), the
high-angular momentum, high-velocity giant-impact models (e.g.,
postimpact Earth is a distended vapor-rich structure from which the Moon forms, a formation
pathway that has become the focus of recent work (Lock et al. 2018).

1.2.2. Mercury formation in erosive collisions.
Just as the Moon’s small core has been at-
tributed to a giant-impact origin, Mercury’s large core has been attributed to a giant impact of a
particularly destructive nature (Smith 1979). As indicated by data from NASA’s MESSENGER
mission and by earlier measurements of Mercury’s large uncompressed density, the planet’s core-
mass fraction of (cid:24)70% far exceeds that of the other terrestrial planets (25–35%) and the iron
fraction expected from early Solar System materials (Palme & O’Neill 2003). Giant-impact sim-
ulations demonstrated that an impactor colliding at several multiples of vesc into proto-Mercury
(a relatively high-energy collision) is indeed capable of stripping the target of most of its mantle,
forming a planet with a large core (Benz et al. 1988). Ejected materials, however, may reaccumu-
late onto the target, counteracting the initial mantle stripping (e.g., Benz et al. 2007). As such,
the giant-impact models for Mercury formation continue to undergo testing and revision (Ebel &
Stewart 2018), and models of nonimpact origin continue to provide alternatives to this hypothesis
(e.g., Johansen & Dorn 2022).

1.2.3. Hit-and-run collisions. A central challenge to forming planets with large cores by erod-
ing the target’s mantle materials in a near–head-on giant impact is that these scenarios are generally
not common (Figure 2b). When vcoll=vesc is high enough, an off-axis collision can result in the
impactor glancing the target and escaping along deflected orbits as a runner (Agnor & Asphaug
2004). In this hit-and-run outcome, the impactor avoids accretion and continues along a deflected
orbit around the central star as a body distinct from the target (Asphaug et al. 2006). To achieve the

order to have sufficient v1 ( Jackson et al. 2018). Such a collision has high angular momentum, al-
lowing for the production of postimpact disks from which satellites can form, motivating the explo-
ration of hit-and-run collisions as a potential model for Moon formation (e.g., Reufer et al. 2012).
Hit-and-run collisions preferentially strip outer mantle materials of the impactor (Figure 3),

which is larger for the target due to its larger mass. As a result, the target tends to preferentially
accrete the mantle of the runner, acting as a gravitational sink for impact debris. The effectiveness
at which impactors are eroded in hit-and-run collisions and the sequestration of mantle debris
by the target led to the proposal that Mercury could be the runner of a hit-and-run collision
instead of the target in an erosive collision (Asphaug & Reufer 2014). Analogous to what the
target experiences in an erosive head-on collision, runners in hit-and-run collisions experience
hydrostatic unloading of deep mantle rocks by upward of several tens of percent of pressure,
potentially generating melt and the release of volatiles (Asphaug et al. 2006).

But what is the orbital-dynamical fate of the runner in a hit-and-run collision? Planet forma-
tion studies that take into account hit-and-run outcomes have demonstrated that the runner can
recollide with the target (Chambers 2013). Reimpact is likely because the deflected postimpact
orbits of the two bodies intersect at the original impact point in inertial space. The returning
impactor can hit-and-run as well, starting a series of interconnected recollision events called col-
lision chains (Emsenhuber & Asphaug 2019a). However, the recollision is not immediate and has
been shown to occur tens of millions of years later for chains in the Solar System near 1 AU (e.g.,
Emsenhuber & Asphaug 2019b). Collision chains have recently been shown to be a viable mech-
anism of Moon formation (e.g., Asphaug et al. 2021) because each recollision would contribute
to the proto-lunar disk from which the Moon is thought to have formed. The collisions lead to
homogenization between the disk and Earth, helping to explain the remarkable isotopic similarity
between Earth and the Moon. The consequences of collision chains on planetary interior processes
(e.g., planetary dynamo generation and mantle and core convection) have yet to be explored.

2. MODELING GIANT IMPACTS

Impossible to be fully replicated in physical laboratories, giant impacts are understood predomi-
nantly through computer simulations. This places important emphasis on the number of variables
and processes involved in collisions, as well as the methodologies used to simulate them (see the
sidebar titled The Combinatorics of Giant Impacts).

2.1. Dominant Variables

2.1.1. Relative size of the colliding bodies. As the sizes of the impactors relative to the targets
grow, so do the consequences of their collisions. When the impactor-to-target mass ratio is much
less than 1%, a crater is generated on the surface. At a mass ratio near 1%, impactors leave near-
global scars. For example, the South Pole–Aitken basin covers nearly one-third of the Moon, yet
its proposed impactor is estimated to be at most (cid:24)1% of the Moon’s mass (Schultz & Crawford
2011, Wieczorek et al. 2012, Melosh et al. 2017). Even this not-so-giant impact is thought to
have excavated deeply, reaching the ancient lunar mantle, making the crater an important target
of future exploration (e.g., Natl. Acad. Sci. Eng. Med. 2022). In giant impacts, the impactor is

THE COMBINATORICS OF GIANT IMPACTS

The vastness of the parameter space of giant impacts becomes evident even when considering only a few of
the preimpact conditions. Sampling 10 values of collision angle, impact velocity, and relative size requires N D
103 D 1,000 computer simulations, discussed later. Accounting for 10 values of core-mass fraction for the target
and impactor corresponds to N D 105 D 100,000 scenarios. Accounting for the rotational angular momentum of
the colliding bodies adds 6 additional parameters: 2 for the rotational rates and 4 angles to describe the angles
between the rotational axes and the impact plane. Even ignoring the presence of atmospheres, third-body effects,
and thermal states, a full parameter sampling requires N D 1010 D 100,000,000,000 giant-impact simulations! Far
too intensive to explore in this way, giant impacts are a ripe area for the application of machine-driven methods
and advancements in simulation methodology.

larger than 1% of the mass of the target. A prominent example is the Borealis basin on Mars, for
which impact hypotheses demand an impactor that was 9–43% the mass of Mars to produce a
hemispherical magma ocean from which the Mars northern lowlands can form (Marinova et al.
2011).

2.1.2. Absolute size of the colliding bodies. Material strength and gravity moderate the out-
comes of collisions depending on the absolute size of the colliding bodies (Holsapple 1994). The
gravitational binding energy of a body increases with its size (Equation 4). In contrast, material
strength is predicted to decrease with size as larger bodies feature larger and thus weaker flaws
[e.g., the so-called size-dependent strength theory (Weibull 1939)]. Flaws act as nucleation sites for
fractures that lead to the failure of the material. As such, there exists a poorly understood threshold
size (roughly a few hundred meters in diameter) where bodies are the easiest to erode for a given
specific impact kinetic energy (e.g., Benz & Asphaug 1999). Below and above the threshold size,
the impact outcomes are said to be strength dominated and gravity dominated, respectively.

Importantly, material strength can still play a role in giant impacts between large bodies that
would otherwise be understood to be gravity dominated based on their size. Rheological effects
such as friction and the crushing of preexisting spaces (pores) during collisions, for example, have
been demonstrated to serve as a sink for impact kinetic energy, reducing the amount of ejected
materials in giant impacts for bodies as large as 100 km ( Jutzi 2015). The overall consequence
of material strength on the collisional evolution of Solar System bodies larger than 100 km is the
object of current studies ( Jutzi et al. 2019, Jutzi & Michel 2020, Rozehnal et al. 2022). Even giant-
impact models of Mars-scale bodies show that frictional heating causes a broader melt region in
the martian mantle than when friction is neglected, which has important implications for the hy-
pothesized Borealis impact basin (Emsenhuber et al. 2018). Thus, even where the broad outcomes
of giant impacts, such as the mass of the largest remnant, are gravity dominated, other metrics such
as heat and melt generation may depend critically on the absolute scale of the collision and the
assumed rheology.

The presence of a core and the effects of compression under self-gravity also have important
consequences for the susceptibility of planetary bodies to disruption. Under self-gravity, mantle
materials become compressed at depth, causing some minerals to transition to their higher-density
crystal structures, increasing the bulk density of a planet. In addition, during differentiation, higher
density materials become centrally concentrated into planetary centers, forming cores. In both
processes, the gravitational binding energy of the planet (Equation 4) increases, exceeding that of
the constant density assumption (Equation 5). The total binding energy of the colliding system,
which is the sum of the binding energies of the target and impactors (Equation 4) and the orbital

can exceed the constant-density approximation by 10% or more depending on the core-mass
fractions of the colliding bodies and their absolute size (Gabriel et al. 2020). This deviation is
noteworthy, as the ratio of kinetic energy to the total potential (K=U) is a quantity used to estimate
the disruption threshold for colliding planets. This is because collisions with equal values of K=U
result in similar outcomes across decades of the total colliding mass (e.g., Movshovitz et al. 2016).
Whether this finding holds true for super-Earths and more exotic planetary compositions [e.g.,
dense, likely iron-rich planets in the exoplanetary catalog (Adibekyan et al. 2021)] is not currently
understood.

Planetary density may also influence the transition to hit-and-run collisions. Differentiated
and centrally compressed planets feature a concentration of higher-density materials and mass
in the interior (e.g., planetary cores). This concentration of mass in the core translates to less
material being involved in collisions at glancing angles (see the cores in Figure 2 and Asphaug
2010, equation 9). The result provides geometrical context for recent hydrocode simulations that
suggest that differentiated planets more readily undergo hit-and-run (Gabriel et al. 2020). At
the same impact velocities, early planets that have yet to undergo differentiation would be more
susceptible to impactor disruption (Leinhardt & Stewart 2012). And since hit-and-run collisions
lengthen the timescales of planetary growth (e.g., Chambers 2013), the size of a planet’s core may
influence how it evolves through subsequent collisions.

Impact strain.

2.1.3.
Impact disruption and the size distribution of debris in strength-
dominated collisions are controlled in large part by material fragmentation and failure. However,
there are several challenges to account for these rheological processes in giant-impact simulations.
The resistance of a material to deformation (strain), fragmentation, and failure is dependent on
rate of deformation. For impacts, strain rates scale approximately by vcoll=(2RI). Models of dynamic
fracturing and failure developed in the laboratory are used to make predictions at the giant-impact
scale. However, due in part to the difference in scale RI, strain rates in giant impacts are several or-
ders of magnitude lower than dynamic experiments conducted in the laboratory (e.g., Grady et al.
1977). Lab-based models are thus extrapolated to lower strain rates with significant deviations
in results, motivating the development of new models based on first principles and multi-scale
approaches in order to take into account failure processes in giant impacts (e.g., Ramesh et al.
2015).

Strain rate also varies depending on the proximity to the impact site, making different rheologic
models relevant for various regions in the impacting bodies. The concentration of stresses closer to
the interface between colliding bodies is expected to enhance the degree of material fragmentation
resulting in smaller debris sizes (e.g., Grady et al. 1977, Grady & Kipp 1985). Elsewhere strain rates
are lower because stresses are driven by tidal effects over gravitational timescales [minutes to hours
for typical planetary densities (Asphaug 2010)]. Here, models of dynamic fracturing become rele-
vant due to the concentration of shear stresses (Ramesh et al. 2015), and pore collapse and friction
( Jutzi 2015) may also contribute to the overall heating budget and fragmentation behavior. Under-
standing the influence of rheological processes that are characteristic of different zones of the col-
lision through dedicated hydrocode simulations remains an important area of future development.

to a discontinuous change in pressure and density across the wave front, transforming kinetic
energy into heat, leading to phase change and the production of vast amounts of melt, vapor,
and plasma. This effectively overwhelms the rheological processes discussed previously. Melt and
vapor production from shocks are expected to be enhanced in warm planetary embryos such as
those emerging from the nebular phase (e.g., Weiss & Elkins-Tanton 2013) because they are closer
to thermodynamic thresholds for melting and vaporization of planetary materials (Davies et al.
2020).

Due to the dependence of impact velocity on vesc, the sound speed in solid water (ice) al-
lows shock-inducing collisions to occur in giant impacts between bodies roughly the size of Pluto

pressure crystalline phases of water and, upon release, can produce ample steam in the process,
motivating new shock equations of state to describe water under a wider range of conditions
(Stewart et al. 2008). A central challenge in modeling the fate of debris in collisions involving

hydrated minerals is that most equations of state implementations do not explicitly account for
the devolatilization and rehydration process that would occur within impact plumes. Further de-
velopments in this area are key to refining models of icy body collisions, such as those posited for
the formation of the Pluto-Charon system and the Haumea collisional family (e.g., Brown et al.
2007, Leinhardt et al. 2010, Canup 2011, Kenyon & Bromley 2014).

For rocky bodies, the dynamical evolution of giant-impact debris is likely influenced by its
thermodynamic state. Debris-debris collisions between solid particles have a strong control on the
lifetime and size distribution of the debris cloud (e.g., Jackson et al. 2014, Kobayashi et al. 2019).
As colliding bodies grow larger than the Moon, their collision velocities are supersonic, transition-
ing them from producing mostly solid debris driven by material fragmentation to predominantly
producing debris in the form of melt and vapor (Gabriel & Allen-Sutter 2021) (Figure 4). The
process generates melt in planetary mantles (e.g., Nakajima et al. 2021), and in Earth-scale gi-
ant impacts (vesc > 10 km/s) collisions cause rocks to reach stellar temperatures (Canup 2004)
(see also videos in the Supplemental Materials). Modeling these extreme conditions at high fi-
delity demands continued development of new shock equations of state (e.g., Root et al. 2018)
and the inclusion of thermal radiation, chemical disequilibrium, and other complex processes in
calculations.

2.1.5. Preimpact rotation. The relative spin rate and orientation of colliding bodies are impor-
tant yet poorly understood factors influencing impact outcomes. For example, preimpact rotation
may enhance the amount of material released to a postimpact disk. In extreme conditions, a body
rotating near the limit of its stability requires only a small perturbation to deliver mass shedding
consequences (e.g., Dobrovolskis 1990). This mechanism of angular momentum transfer from
the rotating planets to postimpact disks naturally motivates the exploration of preimpact rotation
on the formation of the Moon (e.g., Rufu et al. 2017). In addition to potentially contributing to
the generation of disks, preimpact rotation can eject materials into different orbits than expected
from models of collisions between nonrotating bodies. Thoroughly parameterizing the effects of
preimpact rotation on giant impacts, however, continues to present a major challenge, as it en-
tails expanding the parameter space considerably beyond the few basic parameters of mass ratio,
velocity, and collision angle.

2.2. Computer Simulations

The outcomes of giant impacts are predominantly studied through computer simulations and in
particular the Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method (Figure 5). The advancement
of computational power has allowed for the wider exploration of preimpact conditions, such as
core-mass fraction and material type (Marcus et al. 2009, 2010; Reufer 2011). Improvements in
resolution have also allowed for postimpact disks and the debris-size distribution to be under-
stood in greater detail (e.g., Nakajima & Stevenson 2014, Genda et al. 2015). Furthermore, novel
machine-learning methods now enable generalizing the results of sparse data sets of SPH simula-
tions to provide predictions over the relevant parameter space (e.g., Cambioni et al. 2019, Timpe
et al. 2020).

Developed in the 1970s for stellar astrophysics applications (e.g., Gingold & Monaghan 1977),
such as the mergers of stars and galaxies, SPH was extended to giant-impact studies in the 1990s
(e.g., Benz & Asphaug 1999) and continues to undergo refinements today (e.g., Monaghan 2012).
The method discretizes the model domain (planets) into mass particles (sometimes referred to
as nodes), ensuring conservation of mass throughout the simulation. Particles move according to
fluid motion described by the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations of motion (for a review,
see Violeau 2012). Each particle serves as a point of interpolation for continuous fluid properties

artificial viscosity, which ensures that momentum fields are differentiable and provides a shock
heating mechanism (e.g., Gingold & Monaghan 1977). The pairwise force of gravity between
particles would normally require computationally expensive calculations of order N 2 (where N is
the number of SPH particles). Instead, planetary and astrophysical SPH codes implement approx-
imation methods, such as hierarchical tree-based algorithms, which afford critical improvements
to the rapid calculation of gravity (Barnes & Hut 1986), enabling higher-resolution simulations
for a given run time.

Similar to other methods, accurate interpretation of SPH results requires taking into account
possible artifacts that depend on simulation design. The number of SPH particles over which the
planets are subdivided defines the simulation resolution and has a marked effect on outcome. The
highest-resolution simulations now approach tens of millions of particles, but a planet divided into
millions of equal-mass particles still has only hundreds along the radial dimension, limiting the
resolution of smaller-scale flows, turbulence, and the debris field. This shortcoming produces sim-
ulation outcomes, such as the mass of the largest remnant, that vary as a function of resolution (e.g.,
Genda et al. 2015). Generally, greater particle resolution reduces the overall influence of artificial
tension forces between particles that can arise in SPH (Agertz et al. 2007). Importantly, simula-
tion outcomes tend to converge to a particular value as resolution increases. It is thus critical to
perform what are called resolution convergence tests, where resolution is increased incrementally
until the convergence of an output of interest can be inferred. For common choices in resolu-
tion, the impact energy necessary to disrupt two planets by a giant impact may be underestimated
by tens of percent (Genda et al. 2015). Reaching resolution convergence in the angular momen-
tum of the postimpact disk—a key parameter to benchmark models of Moon formation—also
remains challenging, even at very high particle counts (Hosono et al. 2017). Obtaining higher
resolution in general enables higher-order flow in simulations (more accurate material mixing),
which is important in developing accurate chemical equilibration models in planetary evolution
studies.

Finally, the stability of vapor-rich postimpact structures common to large-scale collisions (e.g.,
Lock & Stewart 2019) is intimately influenced by SPH’s sensitivity to artificial viscosity. Erroneous
triggering of artificial viscosity and momentum transport in shear flows (e.g., Okamoto et al. 2003)
allows for the unphysical collapse of pressure-supported disks (Raskin & Owen 2016). Depending
on the form of artificial viscosity used in an SPH simulation, the production of impact heat, vapor,
and melt can vary (Gabriel & Allen-Sutter 2021). These various artifacts are the topic of current
important efforts to improve the SPH method (e.g., Read et al. 2010, Monaghan 2012, Frontiere
et al. 2017) and represent important hurdles for giant-impact science.

3. GIANT IMPACTS IN TERRESTRIAL PLANET FORMATION

Giant impacts are expected to occur throughout planet formation, under different conditions
depending on the presence or absence of nebular gas and the mass distribution of the bodies.
For terrestrial planets, however, signatures of earlier planet formation processes can be overwrit-
ten by the giant impacts that follow. New models of giant-impact outcomes and the application
of probability theory provide pathways for disentangling the complex nature of giant-impact
histories.

3.1. The Aftermath of Early Accretion

The formation and properties of planetary embryos set the initial conditions of the giant-impact
phase. These initial conditions, which remain debated, influence the nature and number of giant
impacts, thus producing different impact histories for the forming planets.

3.1.1. Giant impacts in traditional formation theory. The traditional view of planet forma-
tion is that terrestrial planets form through collisions among planetary embryos (e.g., Wetherill
1976). Before nebular gas dissipation, mass is distributed within a large number of planetesimals
with low relative velocities. As a few larger bodies coalesce, they undergo oligarchic growth by
preferentially accreting the smaller bodies. This process is expected to create lunar-to-Mars-mass
planetary embryos over (cid:24)105 years in the Solar System (Lissauer 1993, Kokubo & Ida 1996).
After the nebular gas dissipates, gravitational interactions between the largest bodies lead to cross-
ing orbits. Chaotic growth ensues, generating giant impacts occurring across tens to hundreds
of millions of years (Lissauer 1993, Kokubo & Ida 1996, Chambers 2013).

3.1.2. Giant impacts in pebble accretion theory. The recent theory of pebble accretion pro-
poses that the drag by nebular gas enhances the accretion of millimeter- to centimeter-sized
particles (referred to as pebbles) onto planetesimals, forming protoplanets within a few million
years (e.g., Levison et al. 2010, 2015; Johansen & Lambrechts 2017; Lambrechts et al. 2019).
When applied to the formation of terrestrial bodies in the Solar System, pebble accretion models
report a decrease in the number of embryos by a factor of (cid:24)2 compared to classical Solar System
formation theory. This corresponds to an order of magnitude fewer giant impacts (e.g., Voelkel
et al. 2021) or just a single, Moon-forming giant impact ( Johansen et al. 2021), placing critical
emphasis on the nature of that singular collision and its detailed outcome.

3.2. Giant Impacts and Planetary Diversity

A simple statistical exercise can provide insight into the effect of the nature and number of gi-
ant impacts on planetary diversity. Assuming that accretion and hit-and-run are equally probable
outcomes during the late stage of terrestrial planet formation, Asphaug & Reufer (2014) showed
that one can evaluate impact outcomes of N embryos picked out of a jar assuming either accretion
(i.e., one of the bodies is removed from the jar) or hit-and-run (i.e., both bodies survive and are
put back in the jar). They found that each final planet in their model survives two hit-and-runs on
average. Every time an impactor survives as a runner, it loses part of its outermost silicate man-
tle. The greater number of times this occurs in this demonstration, the greater amount of mantle
erosion the body experiences, increasing its core-mass fraction. As a result, the onset of chains of
hit-and-run collisions is expected to increase the diversity of planetary composition.

To track the diversity of the population, we repeat the exercise of Asphaug & Reufer (2014) and
measure the planetary diversity of the evolving embryos as the number of different hit-and-run
species over the total population size (i.e., its statistical richness) (Figure 6). A hit-and-run species
encompasses those embryos that have survived the same number of hit-and-run collisions and
have similar core-mass fractions. We assume that the initial population is composed of embryos
with the same core-mass fraction (that is, diversity of 0%) and measure how diversity of core-mass
fraction increases as a function of number of giant impacts. If long chains of giant impacts occur,
planetary diversity increases rapidly. If instead just a handful of giant impacts occur, as expected
in some pebble accretion models for planet formation, a lower degree of planetary diversity is
expected.

Depending on the number of collisions, the giant-impact process can be so transformative for
the embryos that the information about the nature of the primordial population can be partially or
completely lost. The primordial population is transformed through giant impacts due to the cou-
pled effect of hit-and-run collisions, which increase the diversity of planetary compositions, and
the loss of primordial bodies through accretion onto the larger ones. The latter process—defined
as accretionary attrition by Asphaug & Reufer (2014)—is akin to a loss of genetic history by ex-
tinction and may induce survivorship biases in planet formation studies. However, it is noteworthy

Left axis: planetary diversity as a function of the number of giant impacts. Diversity is measured as the
number of different hit-and-run species—that is, the subset of the population whose bodies have survived
the same number of hit-and-run collisions. Right axis: the fraction of bodies equal to those of the initial
population, whose bodies are identical to one another and never participated in a hit-and-run collision. The
solid curves are the average value of 10,000 runs, assuming that accretion and hit-and-run have 50–50%
probability of occurring as in Asphaug & Reufer (2014). Shaded areas indicate the corresponding 1-standard-
deviation bands. The results do not change significantly when the hit-and-run occurrence rate is varied by
(cid:6)10% [the variability observed in studies in the literature (e.g., Chambers 2013, Emsenhuber et al. 2020)].

that, in the simple exercise of Figure 6, accretion alone is not sufficient to induce the complete
loss of information. Indeed, if we assume that all collisions lead to perfect accretion (another very
unlikely scenario), the embryos would become larger versions of their previous selves but new hit-
and-run species would not form, unrealistically keeping planetary diversity of core-mass fractions
to 0%. This is potentially at odds with the high core-mass fractions of Mercury and the high den-
sity of some M-type asteroids (Asphaug & Reufer 2014) and some super-Earths (Adibekyan et al.
2021). Importantly, these bodies may also form in erosive high-velocity, low-impact-angle colli-
sions, but these events are expected to be rare, at least in Solar System formation (e.g., 10–15% of
the collisions) (Emsenhuber et al. 2020).

3.3. Modeling Giant Impacts in Planet Formation Studies

N-body simulations have greatly advanced our understanding of Solar and extra-Solar System
formation (for reviews, see Morbidelli et al. 2012, Raymond & Morbidelli 2022). These simula-
tions model the heliocentric orbits and accretion of growing bodies for millions of years and have
confirmed the central role of giant impacts in shaping the diversity of planets (e.g., Stewart &
Leinhardt 2012, Chambers 2013, Quintana et al. 2016, Scora et al. 2020). Here, we review the
three predominant methods to model giant impacts in N-body simulations.

3.3.1. Brute-force approach. The most rigorous and computationally demanding method is to
hand off each collision to an SPH simulation for explicit modeling, pause the N-body integration
temporarily, and then feed the results back into the planet formation simulation (e.g., Genda et al.
2017, Burger et al. 2020). The challenge, however, is that each SPH simulation can require days

PERFECT MERGING AND OTHER OVERSIMPLIFICATIONS IN COLLISION
MODELING

Before the advent of fast computers and giant-impact models, two colliding bodies of mass MT and MI were often
assumed to perfectly merge into a body of mass MT C MI without losses to debris. However, decades of com-
puter simulations have shown that this is an oversimplification (e.g., Asphaug et al. 2006, Leinhardt & Stewart
2012). Furthermore, as the masses perfectly merge, so do the rotational angular momenta (Agnor & Asphaug 2004),
which would lead to unphysically high spin rates (Agnor et al. 1999). To hasten N-body planet formation calcula-
tions, artificial inflation factors for planetary radii have often been used to achieve accretion even in noncollisional
trajectories. These shortcuts artificially decrease the amount of material transport throughout the system, reduce
formation timescales, and reduce the degree of dynamical stirring through the lack of close encounters (e.g., Süli
2021, Haghighipour & Maindl 2022), demonstrating the importance in accounting for inefficient accretion.

of computer time, even at modest resolution (e.g., Vacondio et al. 2021). N-body simulations may
take months to complete, depending on the number N of bodies. For hundreds of giant impacts,
calculations can require a year to run (see the sidebar titled Perfect Merging and Other Oversim-
plifications in Collision Modeling). Thanks to recent computational improvements [e.g., N-body
simulations using graphics-processing units (Grimm & Stadel 2014, Woo et al. 2021)], brute-force
approaches may be just within reach.

3.3.2. Scaling-law approach. Scaling laws are mathematical equations that help to predict the
outcome of a physical process based on the results from the same process under different condi-
tions [i.e., scaling results under certain conditions to another (Buckingham 1914)]. For example,
experimental data of impacts into small targets may be used to predict the outcomes of impacts
into larger targets (e.g., asteroids). In this case, target size is being scaled, but other variables such
as velocity can be chosen. Traditionally, scaling laws have been fit to a range of different data types
such as crater observations, nuclear/explosive tests, laboratory experiments of hypervelocity im-
pacts, and hydrocode output (for a review, see Holsapple 1993). The challenge of using scaling
laws for giant impacts is in the choice of the scaling variable. In impact cratering the point-source
approximation is used to choose scaling variables based on the assumption that the deposition of
energy occurs at a single location (Dienes & Walsh 1970). However, in giant impacts, bodies are
similar in size, violating the point-source approximation. The need to revise scaling-law variables
led to the proposal that impact disruption is equal for equal values of the scaling variable K=U
(e.g., Movshovitz et al. 2016). However, supersonic collisions produce deviations from this rela-
tion whose origins are uncertain (Gabriel et al. 2020). Thus, understanding the nature of rheologic
and thermodynamic transitions at various scales and building unified scaling laws that span across
these regimes remain important endeavors.

3.3.3. Machine-learning approach. Supervised machine-learning models are parametric func-
tions that are trained to map inputs into outputs based on a preexisting data set of examples. In
the context of giant impacts, machine-learning models are parametric functions that relate preim-
pact parameters to impact outcomes and are trained on preexisting hydrocode simulation data
sets (Cambioni et al. 2019, 2021; Valencia et al. 2019; Emsenhuber et al. 2020; Timpe et al.
2020). Most of the data set is used to tune the parametric model to fit the output data, and
procedures are adopted to avoiding overfitting. The remaining data are used to assess whether
the trained model can accurately predict the outcome of collision scenarios not seen during
training.

Scaling laws are based on and provide intuitions about the physics of giant impacts, while
machine-learning models provide ultimate accuracy within the confines of existing simulation
results and are trained without physical assumptions (for further discussion, see Cambioni et al.
2022). Caution should be paid when extrapolating the predictions of both methodologies beyond
the limits of the data sets used to build them. Similar to how scaling laws can break down in
certain regimes, a machine-learning model trained to predict outcomes of collisions between rocky
planets should not be used for predicting the outcomes of collisions between sub-Neptunes, for
example. There the initial collision is entirely between atmospheric envelopes, producing unique
relationships with respect to the preimpact conditions (e.g., Marcus et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2015,
Denman et al. 2022).

A rich venue of future research lies at the intersection between the two approaches. For exam-
ple, machine learning can be used to identify previously unknown dependencies between impact
conditions and outcomes by means of pattern recognition through unsupervised classification
methods, aiding the formulation of new scaling laws. The mathematical framework of scaling
laws and machine-learning models can also be used to incorporate new physical processes in
planetary formation models. Typically, processes such as crust formation, geodynamical evolu-
tion, atmosphere formation, and the orbital evolution of debris are not simultaneously included
in N-body studies due to the high computational cost of performing these calculations in paral-
lel. This impedes our ability to match the output of N-body studies to planetary observations for
hypothesis testing. Crustal evolution, for example, is intimately tied to the planet’s impact history.
Ejected debris in the canonical Moon formation model can recollide with the terrestrial planets
over 100 million years, depositing an amount of debris equivalent to a kilometer-scale or deeper
layer, depending on the planet ( Jackson & Wyatt 2012). This occurs despite the minor amount of
total debris mass in graze-and-merge compared to other collision styles. Hit-and-run and erosive
collisions shown in Figure 3 can eject even larger amounts of debris (Leinhardt & Stewart 2012).
Fitting scaling laws or training machine-learning algorithms on data from high-resolution sim-
ulations of these processes and implementing them in N-body studies will significantly advance
the realism of planet formation models, and careful tracking of how the uncertainties of these
processes propagate through the entire calculation is warranted.

3.4. Inverting Giant-Impact Outcomes

For planetary bodies suspected to be giant-impact remnants (e.g., the Moon, Mercury), previous
studies have focused on how to deterministically infer impact conditions from observations of
their properties, such as mass and composition. However, a major challenge to understanding
and solving this inverse problem is that the solution may not be stable. As such, a probabilistic
treatment of the giant-impact process may be preferred.

To highlight the instability of the solution to the inversion problem, in Figure 7 we use a giant-
impact model to understand what impact scenario(s) may lead to a Mercury-like planet based on
its mass and iron content. We explore two possible pathways: The planet is an eroded target body
(Figure 7a, top-left panel) or an eroded impactor surviving a hit-and-run collision (Figure 7a,
top-right panel). Even when we assume to know the masses of the colliding bodies, the solution
exists, but it is not unique: Several combinations of impact velocity and angle lead to the same
outcome. Including the possibility of chains of collisions considerably expands the range of po-
tential scenarios (Figure 7b). Observations of additional iron-rich bodies in exoplanetary systems
may add constraints on the impact scenarios required to erode mantle materials and thus help
rule out regions of the solution space. However, if the number of iron-rich planets remains small,
statistical assessments may not be robust (e.g., Dean & Dixon 1951). In this context, the solution

(a) Goodness of fit of predictions from two giant-impact scenarios that form a Mercury-like planet with a mass M D 0.05 Earth masses
and a core-mass fraction of (cid:24)70%. The planet can be either the largest remnant (Scenario 1) or a runner (Scenario 2). Mass is predicted
using collresolve (Cambioni et al. 2019, Emsenhuber et al. 2020) and core-mass fraction using the model by Cambioni et al. (2021),
assuming an initial core-mass fraction of 30%. Goodness of fit is computed as ((M (cid:0) Mobs)=(cid:27) M)2 C ((Z (cid:0) Zobs)=(cid:27) Z)2, where (cid:27) M and
(cid:27) Z are assumed uncertainties for Mobs and Zobs. (b) Different giant-impact histories can result in an iron-rich body (indicated with the
letter C): a catastrophic collision (e.g., Benz et al. 2007), a hit-and-run (e.g., Asphaug & Reufer 2014), or a chain of hit-and-run
collisions (e.g., Chau et al. 2018).

may be unique but still not stable, as it can change when additional data are considered. Finally, in
any hit-and-run scenario where the iron-rich planet is an eroded impactor, the question remains:
What is the fate of the target?

A possible way to achieve a stable inverse problem and deal with the challenge of small number
statistics is to compare the probabilities P(xjy) associated with different giant-impact scenarios.
This can be performed using Bayes’ theorem (e.g., Cambioni et al. 2022), by treating impact

where the probability P(yjx) of observing y given the impact scenario x is sampled using a
giant-impact model y D f (x). This typically requires computing thousands of model evaluations
to determine y under various conditions. Instead of computing new giant-impact hydrocode
simulations for each evaluation, surrogate models (machine learning and/or scaling laws) that are
fit to preexisting simulations can be used. This Bayesian framework also tackles the small number
statistics challenges because it does not assume that the data are normally distributed, which is
justified only for large data sets (e.g., Kruschke 2010).

The solution of Equation 7 strongly depends on the choice of the prior information (cid:25) pr(x). For
the collision angle, dP (cid:24) sin 2(cid:18) colld(cid:18) coll is the appropriate prior (cid:25) pr((cid:18) coll) (Figure 2). Prior infor-
mation for initial compositions is largely derived from measurements of meteorite composition
and stellar abundance (e.g., Rubie et al. 2016, Adibekyan et al. 2021) because compositional infor-
mation for most large asteroids and exoplanets is limited to their bulk density (DeMeo & Carry
2014, Dorn et al. 2015). The velocity distribution from studies of late planet formation could be
used to exclude certain styles of collisions [e.g., just a few percent of high vcoll=vesc disruptions are
expected (Figure 3)] and knowledge of the largest bodies in a swarm may help constrain the abso-
lute scale of the expected collisions. Important caveats are that impact velocities vary in time and in
location during planet formation, and velocities also vary depending on how impacts are handled
in those calculations (e.g., Chambers 2013, Emsenhuber et al. 2020). The size-frequency distribu-
tion of asteroids or the formation of meteorites such as mesosiderites and pallasites may serve as
important constraints on the nature of Solar Systems collisions (e.g., Scott et al. 2001, Windmill
et al. 2022). Recent observations of debris fields in young exoplanetary systems that are thought
to be impact remnants (e.g., Meng et al. 2014, Wyatt 2021) may also be used as benchmarks for
N-body simulations of impact debris ( Jackson & Wyatt 2012). As such, continued (exo)planetary
exploration and model development, particularly for planets such as Venus, Uranus, Neptune, and
others whose interior structures and compositions are poorly constrained, are essential to build
reliable a priori information for determining impact conditions from present-day observations.

4. CONCLUSIONS

Giant impacts are global-scale, high-energy events that occur between similar-sized planets at
velocities ranging from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers per second. These events can sig-
nificantly change the composition, atmosphere formation, and habitability of planets. The physics
of giant impacts is rich, involving material rheology such as friction, strength, and compaction, and
shock physics processes, which have important thermodynamic consequences that influence the
nature and evolution of impact debris. Over several decades, computer simulations have shown
that outcomes range from accretion of the impactor by the target to erosion of the target, po-
tentially leading to distended postimpact structures dominated by vapor and melt, depending on
impact velocity. Off-axis collisions are common, leading to the transient or permanent survival of
the impactor depending on the velocity. Long collision chains are also possible, with unknown
consequences for debris disks around the postimpact bodies.

For these reasons, giant impacts are understood to be important contributors to the observed
diversity and configuration of the Solar System terrestrial planets, asteroids, and exoplanets.
However, many challenges and exciting opportunities for future work remain. The transition be-
tween different collision regimes is unclear due to the poorly understood sensitivity of outcomes

to parameters such as preimpact rotation; the equation of state; and the relative importance of
material strength, gravity, and vaporization at different scales. The postimpact evolution of giant
impacts also likely demands the addition of important, yet commonly unmodeled, physical and
chemical processes. Linking giant-impact diversity to planetary diversity and pinpointing unique
scenarios for the formation of suspected giant-impact remnants also remain challenging. This is
due to the chaotic nature of planetary gravitational interactions and the dependence of planetary
diversity on the number and types of giant impacts. The Moon-forming giant impact is the event
for which we may have the most constraints; yet, many collision hypotheses remain plausible.
At the frontier, improving hydrocode calculations; building a statistical understanding of giant
impacts; taking advantage of the growing data set of exoplanets and debris disks; and developing
new scaling laws, machine-learning methods, and N-body simulations are key endeavors.

FUTURE ISSUES

1. Improving the treatment of heating and including additional physics to model postim-
pact effects in planetary hydrocodes are necessary steps toward testing competing impact
hypotheses for the formation of the Moon, Mercury, and other suspected giant-impact
products.

2. New machine-learning models and scaling laws would enable more detailed and realistic

outcomes of giant impacts to be included in N-body planet formation studies.

3. Dedicated modeling of debris and other improvements to N-body and SPH simulations
are necessary to interpret recent observations of debris disks around nearby stars and can
provide new insights into the formation of small Solar System bodies.

4. The nonuniqueness of giant-impact inverse problems and the small number statistics
of planetary accretion can be tackled through statistical frameworks such as Bayesian
inference.
