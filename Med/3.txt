Background: The difference in underlying pathophysiology in different congenital heart disease (CHD) may
have an inﬂuence on clinical outcome. It remains unclear whether the effect of sildenaﬁl on pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH) varies in different types of CHD.
Hypothesis: The potential effect of sildenaﬁl on pulmonary arterial hypertension related to CHD may be
associated with shunt location.
Methods: In this 12-week, prospective, open label, multicenter trial, 55 patients with CHD were divided into
the 3 groups: atrial septal defects group (ASD, n = 15), ventricular septal defects group (VSD, n = 24), and
patent ductus arteriosus group (PDA, n = 16). Exercise capacity, hemodynamic parameters, and arterial oxygen
saturation were assessed at baseline and after sildenaﬁl therapy (25 mg, 3 times daily).
Results: Six-minute walk distance signiﬁcantly increased from 377.2 ± 68.7 m to 436.0 ± 70.4 m in patients
with ASD, from 371.2 ± 66.0 m to 413.7 ± 83.1 m in VSD, and from 384.3 ± 90.2 m to 440.9 ± 71.8 m in PDA
(P < 0.01, respectively). Moreover, sildenaﬁl also improved the pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary
blood ﬂow index in the 3 groups, whereas no signiﬁcant changes in systemic vascular resistance and systemic
arterial pressure were observed. However, arterial oxygen saturation was signiﬁcantly improved in the ASD
group only. The incidence of adverse events was similar among the 3 groups.
Conclusions: Sildenaﬁl therapy seems to be effective and safe for PAH secondary to ASD, VSD, and PDA,
although some clinical and hemodynamic parameters were changed in a different manner among the 3 groups.

Introduction
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a common, long-
term complication in congenital heart disease (CHD),1,2
which may persist even after shunt closure by surgical
or percutaneous means. Simple CHD can be categorized
as pretricuspid such as atrial septal defects (ASD) and

post-tricuspid such as ventricular septal defects (VSD), or
patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) lesions.1 Severity of PAH is
related to the location of the intracardiac defect.2 In addition,
because the direction and magnitude of ﬂow across the
shunt in post-tricuspid lesions is largely dependent on the
ratio between pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic
vascular resistance, the use of disease-targeting therapies,
which may potentially lower systemic vascular resistance
more than pulmonary vascular resistance, may be at risk
of aggravating the right-to-left shunt.3,4 Thus, the difference
in underlying pathophysiology in the different CHDs may
have a potential inﬂuence on treatment outcome.3,5 This
highlights the importance of evaluating the safety and
efﬁcacy of disease-targeting therapies in the different types
of CHD.

A previous study has suggested that a treatment effect
of bosentan in patients with PAH related to Eisenmenger
the location of septal
syndrome was independent of
defect.4 Some studies have demonstrated that sildenaﬁl
is a safe and effective treatment for PAH related to CHD
and/or Eisenmenger syndrome.6 – 10 However, no study has
speciﬁcally assessed its effect in the different types of CHD,
and it remains unclear whether the effect of sildenaﬁl on
pulmonary arterial hypertension varies in different types of
CHD. The objective of the present study was, therefore, to
evaluate efﬁcacy and safety of oral sildenaﬁl in patients with
PAH secondary to ASD, VSD, or PDA, respectively.

Methods
Study Population
Patients with PAH associated with simple CHD were
they had persistent PAH at 5 years after
included if
(ASD group, n = 1;
surgical or
interventional
VSD group, n = 2; PDA group, n = 1), or if they were
not eligible for surgical or
treatment
because of Eisenmenger syndrome (ASD group, n = 12;
VSD group, n = 20; PDA group, n = 15), or economic
problems (ASD group, n = 2; VSD group, n = 2). The
exclusion criteria were the following: (1) a positive acute
treatment with PAH-
vasodilator response; (2) current
speciﬁc therapy; (3) inability to perform a 6-minute walk
test or with a 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) of <100 m
or >500 m; (4) previously diagnosed heart diseases such as
serious cardiac arrhythmias, unstable angina pectoris, and
myocardial infarction; (5) low blood pressure (<90/50) or
uncontrolled hypertension (>170/110 mm Hg); (6) positive
pregnancy test or breastfeeding practice, and (7) history
or suspicion of inability to cooperate. This study complied
with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
institutional review board of Fu Wai Hospital. A written
informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Study Design and Procedures
The study of oral sildenaﬁl therapy on PAH associated with
the different types of CHD was a 12-week, prospective, open
label, multicenter trial. Primary endpoint was deﬁned as the
change in 6MWD from baseline to week 12. Secondary
endpoints were deﬁned as changes in World Health
Organization (WHO) functional class, Borg dyspnea index,
arterial oxygen saturation, and hemodynamic parameters
from baseline to week 12.

There were 55 patients with PAH related to CHD
enrolled. Diagnosis of PAH was conﬁrmed using right
heart catheterization. In this study, 3 groups were identiﬁed
based on the type of congenital heart defects, including the
ASD group (n = 15), the VSD group (n = 24), and the PDA
group (n = 16). In addition to their conventional therapy
(cardiac glycosides, diuretics, anticoagulants) for PAH,
patients received oral sildenaﬁl (Viagra; Pﬁzer Ltd., New
York, NY), 25 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks. Treatment
with calcium channel blocker during the study period was
prohibited. Exercise capacity, Borg dyspnea index (with 0
representing no dyspnea and 10 maximal dyspnea), WHO
functional classiﬁcation of PAH, hemodynamics parameters
derived from right heart catheterization, and arterial oxygen

saturation were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks
of sildenaﬁl. The 6-minute walk test was performed
on all patients according to American Thoracic Society
guidelines.11 Both pulmonary blood ﬂow and systemic blood
ﬂow were calculated using the Fick equation. Pulmonary
vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance were
calculated from standard equations. Adverse events were
monitored throughout the study.

Statistical Methods
Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard
deviation or median (Q1, Q3). Categorical variables were
presented as frequencies and percentages. Statistical
comparisons among the 3 groups were performed using
1-way analysis of variance followed by a least signiﬁcant
difference test or nonparametric test (Kruskal-Wallis H
test). Categorical variables were analyzed using χ2 or
Fisher exact test. Comparisons of the parameters before
and after chronic sildenaﬁl treatment were performed using
the paired t test. Statistical analysis was performed using
the SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) statistical package.
P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

difference in the sex ratio and weight among the 3
groups. The predominant WHO functional class at baseline
was class II. Concomitant medications did not differ
signiﬁcantly among the 3 groups. Patients in the ASD
group were older than those in the VSD and PDA groups,
and those in the ASD group had lower mean pulmonary
arterial pressure than those in the VSD and PDA groups.
Pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic blood ﬂow
index were signiﬁcantly higher in the PDA group than
those in the ASD group. There was no signiﬁcant difference
in the 6MWD, WHO functional class, Borg dyspnea index,
mean systemic arterial pressure, and pulmonary blood ﬂow
index among the 3 groups at baseline.

Effect of Sildenaﬁl on Exercise Capacity, Functional Status,
Arterial Oxygen Saturation, and Mean Systemic Arterial
Pressure
Results of the exercise capacity, functional status, arterial
oxygen saturation and mean systemic arterial pressure in

the 3 groups at baseline and at 12 weeks are shown in
Table 2. The 6MWD increased signiﬁcantly in all groups
compared with baseline values (Figure 1). There was a
signiﬁcant decrease in Borg dyspnea index in the ASD
group compared with baseline, but it did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance in the VSD and PDA groups. The WHO
functional class improved signiﬁcantly in both the VSD
group and the PDA group. In the ASD group, arterial oxygen
saturation improved signiﬁcantly from 90.98% ± 5.04% to
93.26% ± 2.95% (P = 0.019). There was no signiﬁcant
change in the mean systemic arterial pressure compared
to baseline in all groups.

Effect of Sildenaﬁl on Hemodynamic Parameters
The results of the baseline and the 12-week postsildenaﬁl
hemodynamic data in the 3 groups are shown in Table 3.
Heart rate decreased signiﬁcantly in the ASD group. For
mean pulmonary artery pressure, signiﬁcant reduction was
only observed in the VSD group. However, pulmonary blood

was a trend toward decrease in the ASD and PDA groups.

Comparision of Changes in Clinical and Hemodynamic
Parameters in Patients With the Different Types of CHD
There were no signiﬁcant differences among the 3 groups in
terms of changes in 6MWD, WHO functional class, arterial
oxygen saturation, and hemodynamics (Table 4).

Safety
There were 8 patients who reported 10 adverse events
during the study period. Two patients reported more than 1
adverse event. Recorded adverse events included headache
(1 in the ASD group and 2 in the VSD group), ﬂushing (1
in the VSD group), nasal congestion (1 in the PDA group),
tinnitus (1 in the ASD group and 1 in the VSD group),
menorrhagia and irregular menstrual cycles (2 in the VSD
group and 1 in the PDA group). Most adverse events were
mild to moderate in degree. No patient died during the
12-week trial period. The incidence of adverse events was
similar among the 3 groups.

Discussion
There was no data available regarding the effect of sildenaﬁl
on pulmonary arterial hypertension in the different types
of CHD. Our study, for the ﬁrst time, demonstrated that
the use of sildenaﬁl could improve exercise capacity and

a borderline signiﬁcant increase in systemic blood ﬂow
index in the ASD group. Pulmonary vascular resistance
decreased by 30.89% (ASD group), 24.76% (VSD group),
and 31.72% (PDA group) to 921.7 ± 384.0 dyn·s·cm−5
(ASD group), 1377.5 ± 682.9 dyn·s·cm−5 (VSD group),
and 1495.5 ± 759.9 dyn·s·cm−5 (PDA group) (P < 0.001,
P < 0.001, P = 0.046, respectively). As compared with
baseline, sildenaﬁl administration for 12 weeks did not
result
in a signiﬁcant decrease in mean right atrial
pressure or systemic vascular resistance in all groups. The

pulmonary hemodynamics without deterioration in systemic
hemodynamics and systemic arterial oxygen saturation in
patients with PAH secondary to ASD, VSD, or PDA.

Signiﬁcant improvement in exercise capacity, decrease in
Borg dyspnea index, and improvement in WHO functional
class were observed in the 3 groups, indicating that patients
were able to increase their exercise capacity with a similar
or even lower level of perceived dyspnea after use of
sildenaﬁl. The mean increase in 6MWD observed in our
study was in the range of 42 to 59 m, which is similar
to the ﬁnding in the sildenaﬁl use in the PAH study in
which the mean placebo-corrected treatment effect was
about 45 m after sildenaﬁl therapy (20 mg, 3 times daily).12
As poor exercise capacity is associated with increased risk
of hospitalization or death in patients with CHD,13 and it
has been widely used as the primary endpoint in most
pivotal PAH clinical trials,12,14,15 the use of sildenaﬁl, which
can improve exercise capacity, may also result in reduction
in hospitalization and death as shown in the Dimopoulos
et al study.16

In our study, mean pulmonary arterial pressure and
pulmonary vascular resistance in the VSD or PDA groups
were higher than those in the ASD group. However,
pulmonary blood ﬂow index and functional status were
similar among the 3 groups. This phenomenon may be
attributed to the adaptation of the right ventricle to high
pressure with time.7

Treatment with sildenaﬁl caused signiﬁcant improve-
ment in pulmonary hemodynamics in terms of pulmonary
vascular resistance and pulmonary blood ﬂow index in all
groups. Sildenaﬁl did not adversely affect systemic hemo-
dynamics. This is consistent with previous studies and
reﬂects the pulmonary selectivity of sildenaﬁl.17,18 The fact
that heart rates did not increase in this study suggests
that sympathetic activation was probably not the mech-
anism for the observed increase in the pulmonary blood
ﬂow index.9,19 The increase in pulmonary blood ﬂow index
accompanied by a signiﬁcant reduction in pulmonary vas-
cular resistance in our study suggested that reduction in
right ventricular afterload might be 1 of the reasons leading
to increase in pulmonary blood ﬂow index. These results
are consistent with previous studies.9,19 Sildenaﬁl is able to
relax pulmonary arterial smooth muscle by enhancing nitric
oxide-mediated pathway and has an antiproliferative effect
on human pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells.20,21 In
our study, patients with VSD or PDA suffered from more
severe vascular remodeling and therefore might be less
responsive to vasodilator stimuli. However, the observed
reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance was similar
among the 3 groups. This may imply that reversal of the
pulmonary vascular remodeling plays important part in the
decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance.

Our study demonstrated that the changes from baseline in
exercise capacity and hemodynamics were not signiﬁcantly
dissimilar among the 3 groups. These results are in
agreement with the results of Breathe-5 subgroup analysis.4
These data suggest that the use of sildenaﬁl in the treatment
of patients with PAH related to simple CHD may be
considered irrespective of the type of defect.

Instead of causing reduction of arterial oxygen saturation
the right-to-left shunt, sildenaﬁl

due to aggravation of

actually improved arterial oxygen saturation in patients with
ASD signiﬁcantly as well as in patients with VSD and PDA,
although not signiﬁcantly. The increase in arterial oxygen
saturation may be the result of improvement in pulmonary
blood ﬂow, better ventilation/perfusion matching, and
reduction in right-to-left shunt secondary to decrease in
pulmonary vascular resistance.9,18

Interestingly, the baseline arterial oxygen saturation in
the ASD group was found to be higher than that in VSD
and PDA group, and the improvement in arterial oxygen
saturation was also the greatest among the 3 groups. One
possible reason is that PAH secondary to ASD is usually less
severe compared to that in VSD and PDA. It is demonstrated
that pulmonary vascular abnormalities correlated with
the overall index of ventilation-perfusion mismatch.22 The
less severe remodeling of the vascular bed in the ASD
in
group may be associated with better improvement
ventilation/perfusion matching and therefore the increase
in arterial oxygen saturation.

There were several

limitations in our study such as
uncontrolled and nonblinded design, relatively small sample
size, and short-term observation periods. The long-term
effects of sildenaﬁl on patients with CHD need to be
investigated.

Conclusion
In our present study,
time,
demonstrated that sildenaﬁl therapy seems to be effective
and safe for PAH secondary to ASD, VSD, and PDA,
although some clinical and hemodynamic parameters were
changed in a different manner between the 3 groups.
