Abstract.  Objectives:  Chest  X-ray  is  correlated  with  pulmonary  function  of  asbestos  related  disease.  These 
correlations limited by low specific and sensitive. Computed tomography (CT) more sensitive. There was no 
adopted for the measurement of CT. Our aim in this study was to determine correlation between pleural plaque 
(PP) volume and lung function for use improving classification with CT. Methods: The study included 75 pa-
tients with environmental asbestos exposure. PP areas measured in patients were divided by the patient lung 
area to determine PP ratio with CT. Diffusing capacity and six minute walking distance (6MWD) measured 
and evaluated quality of life. Results: PP identified in 66 (88%) of the patients with CT. PP most frequently 
noted in the front right quadrant and had an average plaque volume of 7729,17 mm3. Plaque ratio taken as the 
percentage of the ratio to the lung volume, mean plaque percentage was 0,37±0,45% (0,003-2,3). In 12(18,1%) 
of the patients, asbestosis not seen with chest X-ray was detected with CT. Conclusions: PP volume and ratios 
were not statistically significantly correlated with respiratory functions, exercise capacity, cumulative amount of 
exposure. Patient of asbestos disease total lung capacity was lower, 6MWD distance was shorter and quality of 
life was poorer. (Sarcoidosis Vasc Diffuse Lung Dis 2017; 34: 336-342)

Methods

Study population

The  soil  around  the  Denizli  region  contains 
tremolite asbestos (7). The study included 75 patients 
who had radiological findings consistent with envi-
ronmental asbestos exposure as defined by Chest X-
ray. Patients who had none of the exclusion criteria 
listed  below  were  admitted  to  the  study  after  they 
have read and signed the informed consent form. 

Exclusion criteria

Clear  contraindications  for  6MWD  were  his-
tory of instable angina or heart attack during the last 
one month and clear contraindications for diffusion 
test  were  chest  or  abdominal  pain  for  any  reason, 
increased oral or facial pain or deformity associated 
with mouthpiece, stress incontinency, dementia and 
confusion.

CT Examinations and interpretation of CT images

CT scans performed using a 16-lead instrument 
(Briliance  CT  16  v2.00  Philips  Medical  Systems). 
Patients were in supine position and holding breath, 
sections  from  the  lung  apex  to  costophrenic  sinuses 
were scanned. Intravenous (iv) contrast agent was not 
administered  to  the  patients  for  this  investigation. 
The  following  low-dose  investigational  parameters 
applied:  kV  120,  mAs  30,  collimation  16x1,5  mm, 
section thickness of 1 mm, reconstruction range 0,5 
mm. Once the scan was complete, all the images were 
reconstructed using soft a tissue and a bone filter. Im-
ages were then loaded to the workstation (extended 
Brilliance  Workspace  v3.5,0  Philips  Medical  Sys-
tems). Each of the obtained images evaluated by a ra-
diologist, experienced in chest CT, from the radiology 
department. PP divided into 4 quadrants (front right, 
rear  right,  front  left,  rear  left)  in  the  axial  plane  for 
evaluation. Quadrants divided at the esophageal line 
in  the  axial  plane.  The  longest  diameters  of  the  PP 
in these 4 quadrants were taken individually and the 

337

values recorded. (Figure 1) Longest diameters of both 
hemidiaphragmatic PP and pericardial plaques meas-
ured at 3 axis and the values were recorded. Lung vol-
umes taken as the longest diameter in the axis meas-
ured and recorded (Figure 2). Craniocaudal distance 
was  measured  from  the  tracheal  line  in  the  coronal 
plane, and transverse and anterior-posterior distances 
were measured at the right mid lobe bronchi branch-
ing line in the axial plane. PP volume measured was 
divided by lung volume to determine PP ratio.

Results

Radiologic findings 

Pleural  plaques  due  to  environmental  asbestos 
exposure  were  found  in  66  of  the  75  patients  with 
chest CT. In most of the 9 patients without plaques in 
CT, calcified lesions accidentally assessed as plaques. 
Six of these patients had findings which could repre-
sent  a  pleural  plaque-like  calcified  appearance  with 
Chest  X-ray.  66  patients  plaques  were  observed,  64 
(96,6%)  costal  plaques,  44  (66,6%)  diaphragmatic 
plaques, and 9 (13,6%) pericardial plaques. PP most 
frequently was front right quadrant and had an average 
plaque volume of 7729,17 mm3. There were no sig-
nificant correlations between plaque volume and time 
passed since the first exposure or cumulative amount 
of exposure. Plaque ratio taken as the percentage of 
the ratio to the lung volume, mean plaque percent-
age was 0,37±0,45% (0,003-2,3). The comparison of 
plaque ratio percentages showed no significant differ-
ence between females an males (p>0,05). Asbestosis 
was identified in 12 (18,1%) of the patients

Diffusion  capacity  measurements  were  per-

formed using the single-breath method.

Respiratory function results

Quality of life

Short  Forms  (SF  36)  developed  by Ware  et  al 
used (9). SF-36 is used in the analyses of individuals 
with chronic disease and of the public health. Sub-
scales grade health from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating 
poor  health  status  and  100  indicating  good  health 
status. 

Statistical evaluation 

Statistical  analyzing  was  performed  using  by 
Windows-based  SPSS  statistical  software.  Chi 
square analyses were used to compare nominal vari-
ables: In the analyses of quantitative data, parametric 
analyses  (t  tests,  ANOVA)  were  used  for  the  vari-
ables that were fit for normal distribution and non-
parametric  analyses  (Mann  Whitney  U,  Kruskal 
Wallis) were used for the variables that were not fit 
for normal distribution. P 05 was considered indicate 
significance.

44 patients were able to complete the diffusion 
capacity  test.  Their  mean  DLCO  (mmol/kPa/min) 
was 5,67±1,67, %DLCO was 89,97±20,79, DLCO/
VA (mmol/kPa/min/l) was 1,38±0,39, and %DLCO/
VA was 90±20,78. A statistically significant correla-
tion  was  not  observed  between  plaque  volume  and 
DLCO%  (p>0,05).  Plaque  ratio  percentages  and 
DLCO  (mmol/kPa/min),  %DLCO,  DLCO/VA 
(mmol/kPa/min/1),  %DLCO/VA,  FRC(l),  %FRC, 
TLC(l) and %TLC were not had statistically signifi-
cantly  correlated  (p>0,05).  Patients  with  asbestosis 
statistically significantly lower TLC (p<0,05). The re-
sult of the diffusion test are shown in table 1. 6MWD 
could not be performed for 13 of the 66 patients with 
asbestos  plaque  due  to  an  orthopedic  condition.  53 
patients  had  mean  walking  distance  369,85±102,43 
(140-720)  meters.  A  statistically  significant  decline 
was  observed  in  percentage  saturation  following 
6MWD  compared  to  baseline  saturation  (Table  2) 
(p<0,05).  After  6MW  test,  a  statistically  significant 
increase  in  heart  rate  (pulse/min),  in  dyspnea  scale 
compared to baseline value (p<0,01). Plaque volume, 
plaque ratio and walking distance were not statistical-

Quality of life

Discussion

Pleural plaque volume measurement with chest
tomography is there a correlation between pulmonary 
function?

Subscales  of  quality  of  life  compared  by  sex, 
males  had  statistically  significantly  higher  scores 
than females (Table 3). PP volume, plaque ratio and 
quality  of  life  alt  subscale  scores  were  not  statisti-
cally significantly correlated. Patients with asbestosis 
demonstrated  statistically  significant  differences  in 
all subscales except the social functioning subscale.

Chest  X-ray  is  used  in  pneumoconiosis  clas-
sification of ILO (10). PP due to asbestos exposure 
irregular  and  occur  on  the  diaphragm  or  through 
the edge of the lung side. Chest X-ray fail short es-
pecially  in  demonstrating  the  paravertebrally  and 
posterior parts of the costal pleura and in revealing 
initial interstitial fibrosis. CT is superior in demon-

starting diseases associated with asbestosis but there 
is no acknowledged classification with CT. There are 
a number of studies proposing classifications that can 
be used with CT in individuals with asbestos expo-
sure.  Meirelles  et  al.  recommeded  a  semiquantita-
tive PP scoring system (11). HRCT was used in this 
scoring  system.  PP  was  examined  by  dividing  into 
4 quadrants in the axial section. PP was grouped by 
size  (A1:  less  than  50%  of  the  quadrant  and  thick-
ness less than 5 mm, A2: less than 50% of the quad-
rant and thickness more than 5 mm, B1: more than 
50% of the quadrant and thickness less than 5 mm, 
B2:  more  than  50%  of  the  quadrant  and  thickness 
more  than  5  mm)  and  was  scored,  and  sum  of  the 
pleural scores from approximately 20 sections taken. 
Diaphragmatic plaques scored were by dividing the 
number  of  tomographic  sections  where  the  plaque 
visible by the number of tomographic sections where 
the  diaphragm  visible.  Because  this  scoring  system 
uses HRCT, it is a source of high-dose radiation and 
given  the  skip-based  imaging,  estimation  of  plaque 
dimensions  is  semiquantitative.  The  relationship  of 
this  staging  with  patients’  respiratory  function  and 
exercise  parameters,  however,  was  not  investigated. 
Aberle et al. proposed a classification by conventional 
CT and 5 additional HRCT sections from the basal 
lung in patients with asbestos exposure but the au-
thors not perform an interobserver and intraobserver 
evaluation for the classification (12). A classification 
reported by Schwartz et al. determined a decrease in 
restrictive lung functions (TLC) with pleural fibrosis, 
but this classification requires dedicated software and 
workstation  and  is  expensive  and  time  consuming 
(13).  Kraus  et  al.  published  a  pneumoconiosis  clas-
sification with HRCT but the classification is com-
plicated and requires a trained radiologist (14). Van 
Cleemput et al. proposed a classification which cal-
culates total lung plaque area by measuring the area 
of  asbestos  plaque,  where  asbestos  plaque  measure-
ments  may  be  subject  to  variation  due  to  sectional 
nature of the CT (15). Jarad et al. proposed a scoring 
with  CT  using  3  mm  sections  and  10  mm  interval 
in  20  patients  with  20  asbestos  exposure.  This  sys-
tem suggests a scoring system that not just addresses 
to plaques but also enables evaluation of PP, fibrosis 
and asbestosis findings together (16). A relationship 
between  respiratory  functions  was  identified  in  the 
classification proposed in this study. This is because 
the  scoring  system  are  affected  to  a  higher  extent 

from fibrosis and parenchymal changes than PP. Be-
sides, the study group that had a higher occupational 
asbestos exposure had a higher fiber load. Most of the 
patients in our study group would be stage 1 or 2 with 
this scoring and stages 3 and 4 would be very few. 

Our  study  involves  quantitative  volume  meas-
urement of PP with non-sectional CT and taking its 
ratio  to  the  lung  volume.  Effect  of  PP  not  similar, 
because of lung volume of patient different. The pre-
vious  study  did  not  assess  lung  volumes.  Therefore, 
our study differs from previous studies, there was no 
correlation between the 6MWT, pulmonary function 
and quality of life impact.

Demographics 

PP  is  known  to  be  associated  with  the  time 
passed since the first exposure, rather than the con-
tacted  dose.  In  a  population  based  study,  the  inci-
dence of PP reported to rise from 0.2% in 1965 to 
2.7% in 1985 in individuals aged above 40 years in 
Uppsala, Sweden (17). In our study, mean age of pa-
tients who were found to have plaques was 71 years. 
Of the patients with plaques in our study, 8 (12,1%) 
were  aged  50-60  years,  18  (27%)  were  aged  60-70 
years,  32  (48  were  aged)  were  aged  70-80  years,  8 
(12,1 were aged) were aged 80-90 years. The young-
est and oldest patients for whom plaque was identi-
fied were aged 53 and 89 years, respectively.

Characteristics of plaques 

Järvholm et al, reported in their review that the 
sensitivity of pulmonary radiography was below 50%, 
in comparison with CT, in detecting pleural plaques 
(18). With Chest X-ray easy to detect large and thick 
plaques  but  difficult  to  detect  costal  plaques  and 
those which are close to the vertebra. In our study, 
asbestos plaques were detected in 66 patients (88%) 
with low-dose CT taken for 75 patients. The patients 
with no plaques with CT findings in chest X-ray that 
could  be  confused  with  pleural  plaque  such  as  cal-
cified  sequelae  fibrotic,  calcified  granuloma.  In  our 
study, the majority of the plaques wbilateral (90,9%), 
followed by right (6%) and left (3,1%) sided plaques, 
respectively.  The  most  frequently  involved  site  of 
pleural plaques chest wall (96,6%), followed by dia-
phragmatic plaques (66,6%) and pericardial plaques 
(13,6%).

Chest x-ray results reported in 6 patients (10%) 
in a study with 58 patients with asbestosis diagnosed 
with lung biopsy, and another study identified no di-
rect radiological evidence in 25 (18%) of 138 patients 
with  asbestosis  with  histopathologically-established 
lung  fibrosis  (21-22).  Gevenois  et  al.  reported  that 
CT  could  detect  early  pleural  and  parenchymal 
changes before clinical evidence occurs (23). A study 
by Aberle et al reported high resolution CT findings 
in about 20-30% of the patients with normal chest 
X-ray (12). In our study, asbestosis was in the early 
stage and therefore asbestosis was not detected with 
Chest x-ray. 

Respiratory functions

PP surface areas and patient’s respiratory func-
tions did not yield a relationship (15). Similar to the 
result  of  our  study,  no  relationship  between  pleural 
plaque volume and respiratory functions.

Diffusion capacity

Abejie et al. reported that patients with asbes-
tosis  findings  lower  diffusing  capacity  lung  carbon 
monoxide (DLCO) values compared to those with-
out  asbestosis  findings  (24).  A  study  with  patients 
with environmental asbestos exposure evaluated pa-
tients’ radiological findings with high resolution CT 
and found DLCO to be within normal ranges in the 
group of patients interpreted to have early asbesto-
sis, whereas there was a pronounced decrease in the 
group  with  evident  asbestosis  and  fibrosis  (25).  In 
our  study,  the  total  lung  capacity  (TLC)  was  lower 
in patients with asbestosis. DLCO and DLCO/VA 
(diffusing  capacity  lung  carbon  nonoxide/alveolar 
volume)  was  not  different  between  pleural  plaque 
patients  with  and  without  asbestosis.  In  our  study 
asbestosis was early stage. 

Exercise capacity

There  are  no  studies  investigating  the  effect  of 
asbestos exposure on exercise capacity. In this study, 
patients’ mean walking distance was 420 meters (26). 
Manali et al. found a mean walking distance of 326 
meters in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibro-
sis  (27).  Lama  et  al  reported  that  desaturations  in 

341

6MWT  was  a  strong  indicator  of  mortality  in  pa-
tients  with  interstitial  pulmonary  disease  (28).  In 
our  study,  mean  walking  distance  was  measured  as 
399 meters in males and 328 meters in females. In 
our study, patients’ dyspnea scale, heart rate /minute 
count  increased  and  saturation  decreased  after  the 
test, with a statistically significant difference between 
pre- and post-test values.

Quality of life

There are a few studies evaluating the effect of 
asbestos exposure on quality of life. Chang et al. re-
ported  that  the  short  form  36  quality  of  question-
naire  was  sensitive  and  practical  in  interstitial  lung 
diseases (29). In our study, physical functioning, pain, 
physical role difficulty, general health perception, vi-
tality, mental health subscales of quality of life were 
lower in 12 patients with asbestosis compared to pa-
tients without asbestosis. 

Conclusion

Pleural plaque volume and ratios were not statis-
tically significantly correlated with respiratory func-
tions, exercise capacity, cumulative amount of expo-
sure. Patients with environmental asbestos exposure 
low 6MW distance, as in other chronic conditions, 
when calculated according to the formula proposed 
for the healthy population. Our study also evaluated 
patients quality of life with the SF-36 questionnaire 
and found that their life quality was affected. In 12 
of the patients, asbestosis not seen with Chest X-ray 
was detected with CT. Patients with asbestosis TLC 
(ml) lower, 6MW distance shorter and quality of life 
was poorer than patient with asbestos.
