ABSTRACT
We present high-resolution spectra and spectroastrometric (SA) measurements of fundamental ro-
vibrational CO emission from nine nearby (≲300 pc) protoplanetary disks where large inner dust
cavities have been observed. The emission line profiles and SA signals are fit with a slab disk model
that allows the eccentricity of the disk and intensity of the emission to vary as power laws. Six of the
sources are well fit with our model, and three of these sources show asymmetric line profiles that can
be fit by adopting a non-zero eccentricity. The three other sources have components in either their line
profile or SA signal that are not captured by our disk model. Two of these sources (V892 Tau, CQ Tau)
have multi-epoch observations that reveal significant variability. CQ Tau and AB Aur have CO line
profiles with centrally-peaked components that are similar to line profiles that have been interpreted
as evidence of molecular gas arising from a wide-angle disk wind. Alternatively, emission from a
circumplanetary disk (CPD) could also account for this component. The interpretations of these
results can be clarified in the future with additional epochs that will test the variability timescale of
these SA signals. We discuss the utility of using high-resolution spectroscopy for probing the dynamics
of gas in the disk and the scenarios that can give rise to profiles that are not fit with a simple disk
model.

INTRODUCTION
As gas giant planets form, they interact with the disk
in ways that are expected to produce observable signa-
tures of their presence. For example, a massive planet

will restrict the flow of material from the outer disk
across its orbit and into the inner disk (e.g., Lubow et al.
1999). This process is expected to result in disks whose
inner regions reveal evidence of the depletion of dust (i.e.,

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

Jensen et al.

gapped disks, pre-transitional disks, or transition disks).
Giant planets can also drive spiral arms in the disk (e.g.,
Fung et al. 2015). Indeed, Dong et al. (2018) point out
that direct imaging of nearby Herbig stars indicates that
∼ 20−50% of intermediate-mass stars harbor a gas giant
planet from beyond ∼30 au.

While the depletion of dust in the inner disk and the
appearance of spiral arms are enticing signposts of planet
formation in disks, other effects can give rise to these
features. For example, Najita et al. (2007b) summarize
three other scenarios that can in principle result in a
transition disk without the presence of a planet: tidal
interactions with a stellar companion, preferential grain
growth in the inner disk, and photoevaporation of the
disk. Similarly, stellar flybys can induce spiral patterns in
disks (Smallwood et al. 2023). Thus the identification of
a disk whose inner region is cleared or whose disk reveals
spiral structures is not sufficient to identify the presence
of a planet in a disk. Unfortunately, direct imaging of gas
giant planets in disks has proven difficult. To date, the
reported detections of forming planets in disks remain
hotly contested with the exception of PDS 70 bc (Keppler
et al. 2018; M¨uller et al. 2018; Haffert et al. 2019).

An alternative way to search for signposts of planet
formation is the use of high-resolution spectroscopy
(R≳25,000) of ro-vibrational molecular emission lines
(e.g., Brittain et al. 2023). The observation of ro-
vibrational CO emission has been used extensively to
study warm molecular gas in the inner disk (e.g., Na-
jita et al. 2000). While such emission is generally not
spatially resolved, the radial distribution of the emitting
gas can be inferred from the resolved spectral line profiles
(Brittain et al. 2003; Najita et al. 2007a; Blake & Boogert
2004; Salyk et al. 2011). Warm ro-vibrational molecular
emission is typically found to arise within the inner ∼1 au
of disks around T Tauri stars (Najita et al. 2003), though
it can be far more extended in the case of Herbig stars
(Brittain et al. 2003, 2007; Goto et al. 2006; van der Plas
et al. 2015). The availability of even higher resolution
spectrometers (R∼100,000), surprisingly revealed that
even many resolved lines were centrally peaked (Bast
et al. 2011). Pontoppidan et al. (2008) applied spectroas-
trometry (SA) to the study of ro-vibrational CO emission
lines that provided additional information about the dis-
tribution of the gas.

SA is the measurement of the center of the point spread
function (PSF) of the spectrum at each wavelength (e.g.,
Bailey 1998; Takami et al. 2003; Brannigan et al. 2006;
Whelan & Garcia 2008; Brittain et al. 2015). In the case
of an emission line arising from a circumstellar disk, the
red- and blueshifted side of the line will be extended in
opposite directions along the slit axis when the position
angle of the slit is aligned with the position angle of the
disk (e.g., Pontoppidan et al. 2008, 2011). As the slit
is rotated from the semi-major to the semi-minor this
offset reduces until none is observed. When the gas is
not axisymmetric, the shift in the center of the PSF can
be more complicated (e.g. Brittain et al. 2013). Brittain
et al. (2015) provided a review of the application of SA to
the study of protoplanetary disks, including the ability
to measure to small scales and usefulness in monitoring
spatial aspects of spectroscopic variability.

Ro-vibrational spectra from protoplanetary disks have
been analyzed with SA in several studies (Pontoppidan

et al. 2008, 2011; Brittain et al. 2009, 2015, 2018; Brown
In many cases
et al. 2012, 2013; Jensen et al. 2021).
the spectra were found to be consistent with emission
arising from gas in a Keplerian orbit in an axisymmetric
disk. For high accreting systems ( ˙M > 10−7), Pontoppi-
dan et al. (2011) found that the radial distribution of ro-
vibrational CO emission was surprisingly compact, such
that if line emission originated from rotating gas within
the disk then the emitting gas must be sub-Keplerian.
Sub-Keplerian rotation of the disk atmosphere is ex-
pected for disks that redistribute angular momentum
via surface accretion flows (e.g. Zhu & Stone 2018; Bai
2017). Pontoppidan et al. (2011) proposed that the lines
observed in these systems arose from a wide-angle disk
wind rotating at a sub-Keplerian orbital velocity, a pos-
sibility which has also been investigated in other studies
without SA (e.g. Bast et al. 2011; Banzatti et al. 2022).
Since the blueshift of the emission is at most a few km
s−1, the outflow velocity of the hypothesized wind can-
not be large. In T Tauri stars, outflows have long been
studied using optical [OI] emisison as a tracer of low-
density, hot gas (e.g. Edwards et al. 1987; Hartigan et al.
1995). Recent studies of low-velocity components of [OI]
found singly-peaked, low-blueshift lines consistent with
a wind interpretation (e.g. Fang et al. 2018; McGinnis
et al. 2018; Banzatti et al. 2019). Modeling efforts have
also reinforced the idea of emission blueshifted by only a
few km s−1 relating to [OI] and molecular winds, includ-
ing CO (e.g. Wang et al. 2019; Weber et al. 2020; Rab
et al. 2022) while the counterflow may be hidden by the
circumstellar disk. While a singly-peaked, low-velocity
wind can be difficult to distinguish from a Keplerian pro-
file with spectroscopy alone, by employing SA it is possi-
ble to reveal non-Keplerian signatures which can differen-
tiate between the two scenarios. If the CO emission from
such a wind is sufficiently far from the disk surface, we
would expect to detect a SA signal directed perpendic-
ular to the disk (Pontoppidan et al. 2011). The degree
of variability of emission lines formed in a wind is un-
certain as there are limited multi-epoch observations of
such sources. If the lines are variable, whether in bright-
ness or spatial offset, it is expected that the timescale of
such variability would be stochastic like that of variable
accretion.

High-resolution, multi-epoch observations of CO emis-
sion revealed further surprises. CO emission from the
transition disk around the Herbig star HD 100546 was
found to be variable (Brittain et al. 2009). Subsequent
observations confirmed the variability, and the applica-
tion of SA enabled these authors to determine the loca-
tion of the variability (Brittain et al. 2013, 2014, 2019).
These authors found that the source of the variability
was a compact source of emission orbiting near the inner
edge of the disk. Such a signal is consistent with emission
from a circumplanetary disk (CPD).

CPDs are expected to extend between 30% to 100% of
the extent of the Hill sphere (e.g., Quillen et al. 2004;
Szul´agyi et al. 2016, 2017). For a 5 MJ planet 10 au
from 2.5 M⊙ star, the extent of a CPD is expected to
be 0.3-1.0 au and reach temperatures in excess of 500 K
(e.g., Szul´agyi et al. 2017). The emission lines from the
CPD are expected to shift relative to the system velocity
on an orbital time scale, a signature that has been ob-

Keplerian and Eccentric Modeling

served for HD 100546 (Brittain et al. 2013, 2014, 2019).
Indeed, radiation-thermochemical simulations of a CPD
orbiting HD 100546 by Oberg et al. (2022) reproduce the
CO luminosity of the orbiting emission reported by Brit-
tain et al. (2013). Another signpost of the presence of a
forming planet results from the tidal interaction between
the planet and the disk giving rise to a persistent disk
eccentricity in the vicinity of the planet (e.g., Papaloizou
et al. 2001; Kley & Dirksen 2006). The ro-vibrational OH
emission lines observed from HD 100546 have an asym-
metric structure that can be produced by a narrow ec-
centric annulus of gas (Liskowsky et al. 2012; Brittain
et al. 2019).

Other effects can give rise to emission line profiles
and/or SA signals that are not consistent with emission
from an axisymmetric disk. For example, a vortex can
also create non-axisymmetric structures in the disk that
have been revealed by sub-mm imaging (van der Marel
et al. 2021). Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simula-
tions indicate that a vortex extends vertically throughout
the disk (e.g. Barge et al. 2016; Raettig et al. 2021) or
may even move away from the midplane and reside at
the disk surface (Barranco & Marcus 2005; Marcus et al.
2013). Vortices in Keplerian disks are anticyclonic and,
therefore, high-pressure regions that are elevated in tem-
perature and/or density, depending on thermodynamics.
The density and temperature fluctuations of gas have a
complicated relationship with the emission arising from
molecular gas at the disk surface. If the gas density is
below the critical density for the vibrational levels of CO
(n∼ 1012 cm−3, e.g. Najita et al. 1996), density fluc-
tuations will have a strong influence on the vibrational
population of the molecules. On the other hand, den-
sity enhancements may quench fluorescence (Thi et al.
2013). Temperature fluctuations in the gas can also affect
the level populations, but they can also affect the scale
height of the gas thereby changing the amount of UV
light captured by the molecules and thus the intensity of
ro-vibrational CO lines (e.g., Brittain et al. 2007). Re-
gardless of whether vorticity enhances or diminishes the
luminosity of CO emission, this effect will be azimuthally
extended and vary on an orbital timescale. The obser-
vational consequences of these three scenarios, as well as
the previously discussed wind scenario, are summarized
in Table 1.

Here we present ro-vibrational CO spectra from nine
disks drawn from Banzatti et al. (2022) for which an SA
signal can be measured. The majority of the emission
line profiles observed among the sample can be repro-
duced with a slab model of a disk that treats the inten-
sity and eccentricity of the disk as power laws. However,
three sources (CQ Tau, V892 Tau, and AB Aur) exhibit
features in their spectroscopic and SA profiles that can-
not be replicated with emission from an axisymmetric
rotating disk and are prime candidates for follow-up ob-
servations and more detailed modeling.

In this paper, we begin with an overview of our sample
followed by a description of the observations and data
reduction process. We then describe the modeling of
the data and discuss the results of our modeling for the
individual sources. We conclude with a summary of the
results of the survey and discuss further observations that
can elucidate the origin of the emission.

2. SAMPLE

We selected nine intermediate-mass

stars within
∼300 pc with evidence of gaps/large inner holes (see Ta-
ble 2). Eight of the targets are known to have structures
such as spiral arms (HD 141569, LkHα 330, EM* SR 21A,
CQ Tau, V892 Tau, AB Aur) and/or rings (HD 141569,
HD 169142, EM* SR 21A, Oph-IRS 48). Here we provide
a brief overview of each target.

2.1. HD 141569
HD 141569 is a ∼2 M⊙ (Guzm´an-D´ıaz et al. 2021) star
with an extended disk (e.g. Clampin et al. 2003) at a dis-
tance of 110.6±0.5 pc (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016,
2018; Vioque et al. 2018). Mawet et al. (2017) find the
position angle (PA) of the disk is 349 ± 8◦ and the incli-
nation of the disk is 53 ± 6◦ based on scattered light L′
imaging which is consistent with the PA (356◦) and incli-
nation (51◦) inferred from near-infrared, scattered light
observations of the outer disk acquired with NICMOS at
1.1 µm on the Hubble Space Telescope (Weinberger et al.
1999). We adopt these latter values to be consistent with
previous modeling efforts (Jensen et al. 2021).

The inner edge of the disk was estimated to extend
into ∼10 au based on modeling of the SED (Malfait et al.
1998) as well as various other structures at larger radii
such as spirals and rings (Clampin et al. 2003; Perrot
et al. 2016; Konishi et al. 2016). This target is further
noteworthy for being between the transition disk and de-
bris disk classifications (Wyatt et al. 2015). Previously
published work, revisited in more detail below, found ro-
vibrational CO emission from 12 to 60 au consistent with
an axisymmetric rotating disk (Jensen et al. 2021).

2.2. HD 179218
HD 179218 is a 3 M⊙ (Guzm´an-D´ıaz et al. 2021) Herbig
Ae/Be star at a distance of 266.0±3.3 pc (Gaia Collab-
oration et al. 2016, 2018). We adopted the disk inclina-
tion of 40◦ from Fedele et al. (2008) and position angle
of 23◦ from van der Plas et al. (2015) for the analysis
in this paper. Previous observation of the ro-vibrational
CO emission indicates that the inner edge of the molec-
ular component of the disk is 11 au (van der Plas et al.
2015; Brittain et al. 2018). However, modeling of the
SED is consistent with the disk extending into 0.56 au
(Guzm´an-D´ıaz et al. 2021), and high contrast imaging in
the J−band with GPI reveals no structure in the outer
disk (R≳20 au) (Rich et al. 2022).

2.3. HD 169142
HD 169142 is a 1.85 M⊙ (Gratton et al. 2019) Her-
big at a distance of 114.0±0.8 pc (Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2016, 2018). We adopt a disk PA of 5◦ and in-
clination of 13◦ (Raman et al. 2006) for the analysis in
this paper. The disk has a variety of features, including
a number of rings (e.g. Quanz et al. 2013; Fedele et al.
2017; Mac´ıas et al. 2017; P´erez et al. 2019) as well as
gaps at various wavelengths, including mid-infrared and
radio/millimeter (e.g. Honda et al. 2012; Quanz et al.
2013; Osorio et al. 2014; Fedele et al. 2017) with a dust-
depleted cavity inward of ∼20 au. A point-like feature in
the disk has been observed over three epochs (Hammond
et al. 2023). The motion of this point source is consis-
tent with an object in a Keplerian orbit and indicates

4

Jensen et al.

the presence of a young gas giant planet. This source of
emission is 0′′.32 from the star at a PA=44◦.

2.4. LkHα 330
LkHα 330 is a 2-3 M⊙ (e.g. Valeg˚ard et al. 2021; Pon-
toppidan et al. 2011; Andrews et al. 2018) intermediate
mass T Tauri star with a (pre-)transition disk (Espaillat
et al. 2014) at a distance of 318.2±3.5 pc (Gaia Collab-
oration et al. 2016, 2018). We adopt the position angle
and inclination of the disk from Pinilla et al. (2022, 28◦
and 49◦ respectively). It is known to have a significant
dust cavity from submillimeter and infrared (IR) imag-
ing (Brown et al. 2008; Andrews et al. 2011; Isella et al.
2013; Uyama et al. 2018) with a size of ∼50-80 au as
well as indications of spiral and asymmetric structure
(Akiyama et al. 2016; Pinilla et al. 2022). Pinilla et al.
(2022) find that they can account for the structures ob-
served in the disk with a 10 MJ planet orbiting at 60 au
with an eccentricity of 0.1.

2.5. EM* SR 21A
EM* SR 21A (hearafter SR 21) is a 1.64 M⊙ (Valeg˚ard
et al. 2021) star at a distance of 136.4±0.6 pc (Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2016, 2018). For the analysis in this
paper, we adopt the PA (18◦) and inclination (16◦) of
the disk from van der Marel et al. (2016). The profile of
the ro-vibrational CO emission lines indicates that the
inner edge of the molecular disk is at 6.5 au (Pontoppi-
dan et al. 2008). Observations at millimeter wavelengths
have yielded evidence of ring structure and a large cavity
in dust, while there is either no gas cavity or a significant
size mismatch (e.g. van der Marel et al. 2016). Other au-
thors have noted features such as gaps and spiral arms,
including an apparent mismatch between the gas and
dust extent (∼7 au inner edge for the gas and ∼35 au
clearing of large dust grains), and have been interpreted
as possible signs of planet-disk interaction (Sallum et al.
2019; Muro-Arena et al. 2020).

2.6. Oph-IRS 48
Oph-IRS 48 (hearafter IRS 48) is a 2 M⊙ (Brown et al.
2012) star at a distance of 134.5±2.1 pc (Gaia Collab-
oration et al. 2016, 2018). For the analysis in this pa-
per, we adopt the position angle (95◦) and inclination
(42◦) of the disk from Brown et al. (2012). Previous
CO ro-vibrational observations with CRIRES showed ev-
idence of a ring of emission co-spatial with the edge of a
dust cavity at approximately 34 au (Brown et al. 2012).
The inner edge of the disk (R∼15-20 au) shows evidence
of eccentricity based on dust modeling compared with
690 GHz continuum observations, which may be caused
by a stellar-mass binary companion at approximately
10 au (Calcino et al. 2019).

2.7. CQ Tau
CQ Tau is a 1.57 M⊙ (W¨olfer et al. 2021) star at a
distance of 163.1±2.2 pc (Parker et al. 2022). For the
analysis in this paper, we adopt the position angle and
inclination of the disk from Ubeira Gabellini et al. (2019,
55◦ and 35◦ respectively). The disk is known to have an
inner cavity of approximately 20 au as observed at mil-
limeter wavelengths, and recent 12CO millimeter obser-
vations with ALMA (W¨olfer et al. 2021). These authors

show evidence of non-Keplerian motion in the inner disk
of the system, possibly due to a pressure profile caused by
a planetary-mass companion. These authors also iden-
tified three spiral arms in their resolved images of CO
emission, ranging from ∼10-180 au. These features may
be the result of a previously hypothesized massive com-
panion (6-9 MJup; Ubeira Gabellini et al. 2019) within
the disk. There is also evidence to suggest a misalign-
ment of the inner and outer disks. Bohn et al. (2022)
found different PAs for the semi-major axis for the inner
and outer disk, being 140◦ and 234◦, respectively. Mis-
alignment was similarly noted by Safonov et al. (2022)
by analyzing shadows cast within the disk.

2.8. V892 Tau
V892 Tau is a roughly equal mass binary system, total
mass 6.0±0.2 M⊙, of Herbig stars with a circumbinary
disk (e.g. Long et al. 2021) at a distance of 134.5±1.5 pc
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2018). The orbit of the
binary is eccentric (e=0.27) with a semi-major axis of
7.1±0.1 au and a period of 7.7±0.2 years (Long et al.
2021). For the analysis in this paper, we adopt a posi-
tion angle of 52◦ and inclination angle of 55◦ (Long et al.
2021). Previous observations at IR and millimeter wave-
lengths have noted features such as an inner cavity (∼35
au in MIR) and spiral arms (e.g. Monnier et al. 2008;
Pinilla et al. 2018; Long et al. 2021).

2.9. AB Aur
AB Aur is a ∼2.2 M⊙ star at a distance of 155.9±0.9 pc
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2018). For the anal-
ysis in this paper, we adopt 50◦ for the position an-
gle of the disk and 20◦ for the inclination of the disk
(Rivi`ere-Marichalar et al. 2022). Position-velocity anal-
ysis of the rotational lines from CO isotopologues indi-
cates that the gas has a non-Keplerian component (e.g.
Pi´etu et al. 2005; Lin et al. 2006) associated with spiral
arms at large radii (∼150 au). This may be the result
of interactions with a companion within the dust cavity
(Poblete et al. 2020). The dust cavity itself has an inner
edge of ∼70 au when observed at millimeter wavelengths
(e.g. Pi´etu et al. 2005), though mid-infrared observations
indicate the gas may extend as close as 0.3 au (di Folco
et al. 2009). Recent observations have also found a point-
like source that is consistent with an embedded planet
within the disk at a PA of ∼ 180◦ East of North and a
separation of 0′′.6 (∼93 au Currie et al. 2022; Zhou et al.
2022).

3. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA
Observations were taken between April 2017 and Jan-
uary 2023, inclusive, with the Infrared echelle spectro-
graph (iSHELL) on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facil-
ity (IRTF) 3.2-meter telescope at Mauna Kea, Hawaii
(Rayner et al. 2022). The resolution of the instrument
is R≈92,000 for the 0′′.375 slit and R≈60,000 for the
0′′.75 slit (Banzatti et al. 2022). In some sources, data
for multiple PAs or epochs were taken as part of an on-
going spectroscopic survey of potentially planet-forming
protoplanetary disks (Banzatti et al. 2022). The targets
were observed in the M-band (spanning 4.5 to 5.2 µm
or 1950 to 2200 cm−1) using an ABBA nodding pattern,
keeping the target in slit while nodding between A and B

Keplerian and Eccentric Modeling

5

positions. This allowed the sky to be removed to first or-
der by combining the images with an A-B-B+A pattern.
Table 3 reports the observing settings for all spectra in-
cluded here.

The observations were acquired to facilitate the mea-
surement of the SA signal of the ro-vibrational CO emis-
sion lines. The center of the PSF can be measured to
high precision, well below the angular resolution of the
observing system, δ ∼ FWHM /(2.35 · SNR), where δ
is the accuracy of the measurement of the center of the
PSF, SN R is the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum,
and F W HM is the full width of the seeing profile at half
of its maximum intensity Whelan & Garcia (2008).

Brannigan et al. (2006) note several sources of artifacts
in spectro-astrometric signals. Some artifacts can be re-
moved by rotating the slit 180 degrees such that instru-
mental effects remain constant while the astronomical
source is inverted. By differencing these measurements,
instrumental effects are removed while the astronomical
source is averaged. This does not account for all sources
of artifacts however. For example, if the PSF is com-
parable or narrower than the slit width, tracking errors
can induce a signal. This signal is most prominent in the
sharpest lines. Artifacts can also appear in telluric lines.
We examined our spectra for artifacts in sources with
narrow lines such as HD 169142 where the emission lines
are only marginally resolved. We do not detect a sig-
nal from this source (artificial or real). Further, M-band
spectra are dominated by telluric lines where artificial
signals are not detected either.

The PA of the slit for each observation is reported in
Table 3. The majority are aligned to or near the semi-
major axis (HD 141569, HD 169142, SR 21, IRS 48)
with some also including observations along or near the
semi-minor (HD 179218, CQ Tau). The observations of
AB Aur were acquired with the slit aligned with the
semi-major and semi-minor axes. A third observation
was acquired with the PA of the slit aligned with a fea-
ture reported by Boccaletti et al. (2020). Of the re-
maining two disks, V892 Tau has two observations, one
along the semi-major axis and one somewhat offset, while
LkHα 330 has only one observation offset from the semi-
minor axis by 26◦.

The data were reduced in a manner typical of IR spec-
troscopy (flat fielding, image stacking, spectra extrac-
tion, etc.) using a custom IDL reduction pipeline; the full
reduction process is described in Brittain et al. (2018).
The raw frames are combined before being flat fielded.
As the iSHELL instrument is an echelle spectrograph,
the spectrum is split into multiple orders, and each is re-
duced separately. As the orders are curved, a low-order
polynomial is fit to the spectrum order being reduced
and then rectified. A first-pass wavelength calibration is
done at this point using the Spectrum Synthesis Program
telluric model (SSP; Kunde & Maguire 1974) as a refer-
ence. Following this, a rectangular extraction window
is used to obtain A and B beam (resulting from the A
and B nod positions) spectra from the corresponding nod
positions which are then combined. Further refinements
to the wavelength calibration are done at this point as
necessary. Once this has been completed for all orders
for both science and telluric standard targets, the ratio
of the two stars’ spectra are taken, removing telluric ab-
sorption features in the process. The spectral ranges with

low flux, approximately 50% or less of the continuum
level as determined by the standard star, are omitted.
Any final adjustments to the wavelength calibration are
made at this point to ensure that the science and stan-
dard results agree with one another. Once completed,
the systemic uncertainty is approximately 1 km s−1 for
the wavelength calibration.

Measurement of the SA signal was accomplished using
the same process described in Jensen et al. (2021). As
in that case, a skewed Moffat function was used because
it faithfully reproduced the shape of the PSF of the con-
tinuum. An initial parameter fit to the profile was found
using the continuum, which it should be noted is typ-
ically thermal dust emission rather than stellar contin-
uum except in the case of the dust-depleted HD 141569,
to determine the typical shape of the PSF. We do not
find evidence for extended continuum emission over the
seeing. Afterward, the entire spectrum was fit, allowing
a more limited range to the parameters, although with
the centroid and peak values still being freely variable.

The SNR of the line profile and SA signal are enhanced
by stacking multiple lines. The lines selected are the ro-
vibrational v=1-0 12C16O lines between 2000 cm−1 and
2200 cm−1 (approximately 4.5 to 5.2 µm). Lines that
were blended with other emission features (e.g. with ro-
vibrational CO lines from other excitation bands or iso-
topologues) were excluded. In addition to blended lines,
unexcited lines (or otherwise of extremely low SNR) and
lines heavily affected by telluric absorption were also ex-
cluded. The v=1-0 12C16O line profiles are displayed in
Figure 1. It should be noted that the SA data shown in
Figure 1 is not a spatial offset, but the pixel shift of the
PSF centroid converted to the spatial scale at the target
disk.

4. MODELING
To characterize the origin of the emission line, we at-
tempt to fit each profile and SA signal with a simple disk
model where the intensity of the emission and eccentric-
ity of the disk are treated as power laws,

I(r) = I0(r/ain)αI
e(a) = e0(a/ain)αe

(1)
(2)

where I0 and e0 are the fiducial intensity and eccentricity
of the disk, αI and αe are the power law indices of the
intensity and eccentricity, ain is the semi-major axis of
the innermost annulus of the disk, a is the semi-major
axis of an annulus, and r is the distance from the star to
a position within the disk.

The disk is divided into annuli from ain to aout such
that the width of each annulus corresponds to a change
in velocity at perihelion of 1 km s−1. If the width of the
annulus is greater than 1 au, then the width is set to 1 au.
Similarly, each annulus is divided into segments such that
the azimuthal extent of the segment corresponds to a
shift in the projected velocity of 1 km s−1. If this results
in fewer than 12 segments around the annulus, then the
annulus is divided into 12 segments. The intensity, area,
and projected velocity are computed for each segment
where the velocity is given by,

v(a, θ) =

(cid:115)

GM⋆
a(1 − e(a)2)

(cos(θ + ω) + e(a)cos(ω))sin(i)

(3)
where G is the gravitational constant, M⋆ is the stellar
mass, a is the semi-major axis of the annulus, e is the
eccentricity of the annulus, θ the true anomaly for all
annuli, ω is the argument of periapse, and i is the incli-
nation of the disk. The profile of the emission line that
arises from each segment is assumed to have a Gaussian
shape with a width of 2 km s−1. The line from each seg-
ment of each annulus is shifted by the projected velocity
and summed to create the spectral line profile. This pro-
file is scaled to the area of the average profile that is
observed. Both the synthetic spectral line profile and
spectroastrometric signal are convolved with the instru-
ment profile at the appropriate resolution (3.5 km s−1
for the 0′′.375 slit, and 6 km s−1 for the 0′′.75 slit).

The SA signal is calculated by measuring the distance
of each segment from the star and projecting it to the
plane of the sky along the slit axis. The product of the
luminosity of the segment and its distance from the star
is divided by the luminosity of the entire line and contin-
uum at a given projected velocity. The distances for each
velocity element of the spectral line are then summed.

The free parameters in our model are the inner and
outer boundaries of the disk emission, the fiducial eccen-
tricity, power-law indices of the intensity and eccentricity,
the argument of periapse of the disk, and the normaliza-
tion of the spectral line profile. We fix the stellar mass,
disk PA, disk inclination, and distance to the star based
on values described in Section 2 and summarized in Ta-
ble 2.

In cases where there is no asymmetry in the line profile
at the SNR of our data, we fix the power law index of
the eccentricity αe at −3 to approximate the radial de-
pendence of of eccentricity found from numerical simula-
tions for a planet/star ratio ≤ 0.003 (see Kley & Dirksen
2006). The argument of periapse, ω at 0◦, is set to 0◦ to
maximize the effect of the eccentricity on the line profile
to place an upper limit on the eccentricity of the disk.
An emission line from a disk will be symmetric for any
eccentricity when the argument of periapse is 90◦. While
the eccentricity of a single disk can never be ruled out
definitively, the fraction of disks that have a non-zero ec-
centricity can be inferred statistically from a sufficiently
large sample.

We run a Monte Carlo simulation for each system and
report the best fit and uncertainty in each parameter in
Table 4. Assuming the emission arises from a disk, the
resolved sources have a unique solution. For the unre-
solved sources, only upper limits can be placed on certain
parameters. The average spectroscopic and SA profiles
along with their best-fit models are compiled in Figure 1.

5. RESULTS
Six of the nine objects are well fit with our disk model.
CQ Tau, AB Aur, and V892 Tau have components that
could not be fit with our model. Here we will discuss the
modeling results for each target.

5.1. HD 141569

The CO emission profile and SA signal are reproduced
with our model assuming the emission extends from 12.5-
43 au and has a relatively flat intensity profile. While the
asymmetry of the line profile is quite modest, we find
that we arrive at the best fit with a significant eccentric-
ity (0.23) that declines sharply (∝ r−5). This is signifi-
cantly sharper than the decline shown in an example cal-
culation by Kley & Dirksen (2006, ∝ r−3) and considered
in Jensen et al. (2021). The power law dependence of the
eccentricity adopted in the model implies that only the
first ∼4 au of the disk would have an eccentricity above
0.05. If the inner rim is indeed eccentric and is driven by
a companion in the inner disk, the dependency of the ec-
centricity on the distance from the inner rim of the disk
scales with the companion mass and the viscosity of the
disk. Exploration of how the induced eccentricity of the
disk scales with companion mass and other disk param-
eters will be the subject of future work. Alternatively, it
could be that there is an elongated vortex at the inner
rim of the disk that gives rise to the modest asymmetry
of the line profile.

One way to distinguish these scenarios is to acquire ad-
ditional observations at similar resolution and SNR. Gas
orbiting HD 141569 at 12.5 au has a period of ∼30yrs.
The data presented in this paper were acquired in 2017,
so in 2024 a vortex will have orbited by about 70◦. The
angle of periapse of the gas on an elliptical orbit driven
by a companion is expected to be persistent over an orbit
(Kley & Dirksen 2006).

5.2. HD 179218
The analysis of iSHELL spectra obtained in 2016 was
presented in Brittain et al. (2018); here we present new
spectra obtained in 2020. Spectra at two PAs, 23◦ (semi-
major axis) and 113◦ (semi-minor), were obtained for this
target. The emission line and SA signal of the observa-
tion with the slit aligned with the semi-major axis were
fit assuming the gas extends from 8-55 au. The eccen-
tricity of the disk at the inner rim is 0.12 and falls off as
∝ r−0.8 - consistent with the effect of a companion orbit-
ing interior to the inner edge of the disk (Kley & Dirksen
2006). The blue wing of the line profile is extended rela-
tive to the red side. Though this fell in a velocity range
that may be affected by telluric absorption, the line pro-
file from an observation acquired in 2016 did not vary to
within the noise of the spectra (Fig. 2). Thus we con-
clude that the asymmetry we observe is unlikely due to
contamination from the telluric correction.

5.3. HD 169142
The spectra of HD 169142 acquired on April 2017 and
August 2017 were combined (Fig. 1). The observations
were acquired at the same PA, but the slit width of the
observations was not the same. The effective resolution
of the observations is determined by the lower resolution
observations (6 km s−1) The profile of the emission line is
only marginally resolved and no SA signal was detected.
The line profile was fit assuming the emission extends
from 2.7 au to 80 au. The SA signal from the modeled
emission falls below the SNR of the measurement (which
limits the outer extent of the centrally peaked line). Be-
cause the line is so narrow and the emission extended,
our upper limit on the eccentricity is 0.25.

lines in the upper and lower panels respectively). The PA of the slit is indicated for the observation presented in the figure. The horizontal
black bars indicate the instrumental resolution of the observation. The best-fit models are plotted in blue, and the residuals between the
data and the fits are plotted above in red. The Doppler shift has been corrected for Earth’s motion and the radial velocity of the star
using the values presented in Table 2. For the targets with multiple observations or epochs, those shown here are as follows: HD 169142
is averaged between Apr. 20 and Aug. 25 of 2017; CQ Tau is from Jan. 21, 2023; V892 Tau is from Jan. 16, 2021; and AB Aur is from
Feb. 6, 2021. The velocity range affected by telluric correction of the low-J CO lines is indicated with vertical gray lines. For HD 169142,
the data from two nights separated by four months were combined so two velocity ranges are indicated. The range containing telluric
absorption for AB Aur falls outside of the plotted velocity range. The SA data provide a measure of the shift of the PSF (emission line
and continuum) and should not be confused with the maximum spatial offset of the emission line.

unoptimized nature of our observations. Deeper observa-
tion of HD 169142 with the slit aligned with the position
angle of the candidate CPD would in principle enable its
detection from the SA signal. While a sufficiently mas-
sive companion should drive an eccentricity in the disk
in the vicinity of its orbit, the large separation and face-
on orientation of the disk would render any asymmetry
induced in the line profile from this region of the disk dif-
ficult to detect with iSHELL in either the spectral profile
because the line is so narrow (∼7 km s−1) while the SA
signal would be comparatively easy to detect with suffi-
cient fidelity and proper alignment.

5.4. LkHα 330
The spectroscopic profile of LkHα 330 is broad and
asymmetric (Fig. 3). The red wing of the line extends
further than the blue wing, however, the core of the line
is extended further to the blue than to the red. The
line profile from Pontoppidan et al. (2011) also showed
asymmetry, but was significantly narrower with a sharper
peak (see comparison of profiles in Figure 8 in Banzatti
et al. 2022). The SA signal detected by Pontoppidan
et al. (2011) is not observed due to the lower SNR of
our observation. The line profile and upper limit on the
SA signal were fit assuming the emission extended from
0.46-120 au. The gas near the inner edge of the disk in
our model has a modest eccentricity (0.08) though it is
consistent with zero at 3σ. Interestingly, we were unable
to find a fit that captured the asymmetry of the wings
and the core at the same time (see the residual in Fig. 3
at +7 km s−1). One way to capture this is by allowing
the argument of periapse to shift phases in the disk (see
for example, Kozdon et al. 2023). Such a scenario is
expected when a companion opens a gap in the disk as
the argument of periapse will precess at different rates
at the inner and outer boundaries of the gap. Whether
this is consistent with the presence of the 10 MJ planet
at ∼60 au hypothesized by Pinilla et al. (2022) will be
explored in future work.

Figure 3. LkHα 330 profile (black) and its reflection (blue) show-
ing asymmetric structure. The velocity ranges covering the low-J
v=1-0 telluric lines are indicated in red. The horizontal black line
indicates the instrumental resolution of the observation. The core
of the and the wings reveal a significant asymmetry. The HWZI of
the blue side of the line occurs near −20km s−1 while the HWZI
of the red side of the line falls near +30km s−1. The core of the
line shows an asymmetry in the opposite direction.

HD 179218 line profile (top panel) and SA signal
(lower panel). In the upper panel, the average profile of all three
observations is presented (in black). The difference between the av-
erage profile and the profile from each observation is plotted above.
The horizontal black line indicates the instrumental resolution of
the observation. HD 179218 was observed in 2016 (Brittain et al.
2018) with the slit aligned with the semi-major axis (in red) and in
2020 with the slit aligned with the semi-major axis (in blue) and
the semi-minor axis (in green). There is no evidence of variability
in the line profile - either temporally or due to changes in the ori-
entation of the slit. In the lower panel, the SA signal for each date
and PA are plotted using the same color scheme. The average of
the SA signal measured with the slit aligned with the semi-major
axis of the disk (in black) is also plotted. The SA signals measured
in 2016 and 2020 are consistent.

A companion has been reported for this target with a
separation of ∼0′′.3 and a position angle of ∼45◦ (Ham-
mond et al. 2023). The position angle of our slit on the
sky was 5◦. If the candidate object has a disk, some of
the emission from the disk could be captured by our slit.
However, the orientation of the slit was not optimized for
detection from this source. Here we assume that the con-
tinuum is coming from warm dust near the star and that
any continuum emission from the CSD is insignificant.
We also assume that 50% of the CO emission comes from
the CPD while the other 50% comes form an axisymmet-
ric CSD. The spatial offset of the candidate along the slit
for this is ∼230 mas when taking into account the 40◦ dif-
ference in the reported CPD PA and our observed PA.
With the line-to-continuum ratio of ∼0.2 the expected
SA offset would be 230 × 0.5 × 0.2/(1 + 0.2) = 19 mas or
∼2 au, which is below our detection threshold. (see, e.g.,
Takami et al. 2003, for the effect of line-to-continuum ra-
tio in the context of SA). As such while we do not detect
evidence of a CPD here, we cannot rule it out due to the

5.5. SR 21
SR 21 includes a central narrow absorption in the low-
J lines assumed to be from foreground gas, so these lines
are excluded from the average spectral and SA profiles
presented in Fig. 1. The best fit model indicates that
the emission arises from a narrow annulus (∆R=1.7 au).
The blue side of the line is somewhat brighter (consistent
with Pontoppidan et al. (2008)), though at the SNR of
our spectrum this is only marginally significant. We can
rule out an eccentricity greater than 0.13 with our data
assuming ω=0◦. The SA signal from our model has a
maximum offset of 1 au. The PA of our observations is
offset by 7◦ relative to the PA presented by Pontoppidan
et al. (2008) that found a signal that extended to 1.3 au
(updated for the distance determined by Gaia).

5.6. IRS 48
IRS 48 includes a central narrow absorption in the low-
J lines, so these lines are excluded from the average spec-
tral and SA profiles presented in Fig 1. The modeling
results for IRS 48, shown in Fig. 1, are consistent with
an axisymmetric disk with an emitting region extending
from 20 to 35 au – consistent with the gas ring noted by
Brown et al. (2012) based on modeling of CRIRES ro-
vibrational CO data, including spectroastrometry. Addi-
tionally we do not find evidence of variability compared
to this previous work. The signal-to-noise of the data
presented here is insufficient to detect the existence of
an eccentricity in the inner rim, with an upper limit of
e<0.17 assuming ω=0◦. The SA signal is well reproduced
by our model.

5.7. CQ Tau
The data presented here were obtained in January 2021
with a slit PA of 47◦ (near the semi-major axis, PA=55◦;
Ubeira Gabellini et al. 2019) and a slit width of 0′′.375,
in January 2022 with a PA of 137◦ (near the semi-minor
axis) and a slit width of 0′′.75, and January 2023 with
a PA of 47◦ and a slit width of 0′′.75 (Table 3). The
profile of the emission lines and the SA signal from each
epoch are complex and variable (Fig. 4).
In all three
epochs, there is a narrow component that is blueshifted
5 km s−1 relative to the star. In 2021 and 2023 when the
slit PA was 47◦, the centroid of the PSF of the narrow
component was shifted along the slit in the southwest
direction. The broad component of the line profile of
CQ Tau in 2023 can be fit if we mask the narrow emis-
sion component (Fig. 1). For this epoch, we find that
the profile can be fit with emission that extends from 0.5-
9.8 au assuming the inner rim is highly eccentric (e=0.27)
and that the eccentricity drops rapidly (∝ r−5). The SA
signal produced by the model is consistent with the up-
per limit across the broad component of the profile. A
wind may be able to qualitatively explain the nature of
the narrow component and the corresponding SA sig-
nal (Pontoppidan et al. 2011). However, rather than the
expected maximal SA offset for the CO emission when
observed along the semi-minor axis of the disk for a wind,
we found the offset of the SA signal was minimal along
that direction while it was much more pronounced along
the semi-major axis. Alternatively, taking into account
evidence of misalignment of the inner and outer disks
by approximately 90◦ (Bohn et al. 2022; Safonov et al.

2022), this is consistent with a wind assuming it is being
launched from the inner disk. At present it is not clear
what the timescale of variability of the emission is (or-
bital, stochastic, or otherwise), but further epochs may
clarify this.

Figure 4. Comparison of the spectroscopic and SA profiles of
CQ Tau observed in 2021 (black), 2022 (blue), and 2023 (red).
The horizontal bars are scaled to the instrumental resolutional of
each observation. A narrow emission component persists in all
three epochs, though its line/continuum ratio varies. The centroid
of the PSF of the narrow component is extended when the slit 47◦
E of N (2021 and 2023) and disappears when the slit PA is 137◦ E
of N.

5.8. V892 Tau
The CO line profile was previously shown to be highly
variable on 1yr timescales (Banzatti et al. 2022). We find
that the SA signal varies with profile of the line as well
(Fig. 5). The data acquired in 2021 shows an asymme-
try with a single peak on the blue side of the line. In
2022 the line showed an asymmetric and double-peaked
line profile. We could not find a parameter combination
that could fit either profile well. A model for a chosen set
of parameters for the 2021 epoch is displayed for compar-
ison purposes (Fig. 1). The SA signal from the model is
similar in extent to the measurement, but it is not a good
fit. If the wings of the line arises from the circumbinary
disk, the gas must extend inward to ∼7 au - significantly
interior to the continuum inferred by MIR interferometry
(Monnier et al. 2008).

candidate by 24◦ on night 2. Additionally it is possible
that a vortex in the disk can lead to an asymmetry in
the surface CO emission. Alternatively, a disk wind can
lead to a signal qualitatively similar to what is observed
here (Pontoppidan et al. 2011). The emission line is cen-
trally peaked, and the SA signal is extended along the
semi-minor axis of the disk as expected in the wind case.
Previous works have found evidence supporting a disk
wind from Hα observations and modeling of the NIR ex-
cess (Bans & K¨onigl 2012; Perraut et al. 2016). Further
observations are planned to investigate these possibili-
ties.

6. DISCUSSION
Of the sample, six of the nine disks (HD 141569,
HD 179218, HD 169142, LkHα 330, SR 21, and IRS 48)
have spectral profiles and SA signals that can be repro-
duced by assuming the gas arises from a circumstellar
disk. Of these six, the two profiles that are centrally
peaked are also nearly face-on (HD 169142 with an incli-
nation of 13◦ and LkHα 330 with an inclination of 28◦).
The outer disk of SR 21 is also nearly face on (i=18◦) in-
dicating that the emission arises from a narrow annulus.
In the cases of HD 169142, SR 21, IRS 48, and AB Aur
only upper limits to the inner edge eccentricity, e0, were
determined using an argument of periapse, ω, of 0 as the
most favorable orientation with a power law index, αe, of
-3, as in Kley & Dirksen (2006). For these six cases, we
cannot at present rule out alternative explanations to a
gap-opening planet or CPD such as a (sub-)stellar com-
panion, vortex, or outflow. Improved or better optimized
observations, additional epochs, or more detailed model-
ing may better distinguish between the various possible
explanations for the cavities/gaps present in this sample.
For all but two of our sources, the CO emission
must extend to very large distances from the star (∼50-
100 au). This is quite different from T Tauri stars where
the emission typically arises from the inner few au (Na-
jita et al. 2003). The excitation of molecular gas by the
much stronger UV continuum of these earlier type stars
might account for the difference in the radial extent of
the emission.

The radial extent of the source of the ro-vibrational
CO emission is not always aligned with the radial extent
of the dust or gas as measured in the (sub)mm. One
such case is HD 169142, where ALMA observations show
a dust cavity inward of approximately 20 au (Hammond
et al. 2023) while the ro-vibrational CO emission extends
inward to 2.7 au. Such discrepancies have been noted
previously (e.g. Banzatti et al. 2018). While an orbit-
ing companion can open a gap in the disk resulting in a
pressure bump that can trap mm-sized grains, gas may
accrete inward. The transition strength of ro-vibrational
lines is about six-order of magnitude larger than for ro-
tational lines in the ground vibrational state, thus the
observations of the former at NIR wavelengths for CO
are more sensitive to warm gas than the latter at submm
wavelengths.

At the SNR of our observations, four of the observed
line profiles are symmetric and upper limits on the ec-

the periapse is 0◦. Of the five sources with asymmet-

of the sources can be fit with a model of an eccentric

Figure 5. Comparison of 2021 (black) and 2022 (red) average
spectroscopic and SA profiles of V892 Tau. The horizontal bars
indicate the instrumental resolution of each observation. The PA is
offset by 35◦ between epochs. While the line profile is asymmertic
in both epochs, the overall spectroscopic profile changed to exhibit
a double-peaked structure, though still with an excess on the blue
side. The SA signal is extended on the red and blue side of the line
consistent with emission arising from an extended disk.

5.9. AB Aur
The observations for this target were taken at three
separate PAs: aligned with the semi-major axis (60◦;
Feb. 6, 2021), semi-minor axis (150◦; Feb. 4, 2021), and
the position of a possible feature noted by Boccaletti
et al. (2020, 24◦; Feb. 5, 2021). The line profile and SA
signal acquired with the slit aligned with the semi-major
axis can be reproduced by our model for emission that
extends from 1-106 au. The line is quite symmetric and
the upper limit we place on the eccentricity (assuming
ω=0) is e<0.05. For an axisymmetric disk, the SA should
vanish when the slit is aligned with the semi-minor axis
(PA=150◦) and diminish when the slit is in an interme-
diate orientation (PA=24◦). This is not observed. The
model is a poor fit to the SA signal when observed with
the slit aligned with the semi-minor axis (Fig. 6).

During the observations (Feb 4 - Feb 6, 2021), the see-
ing improved dramatically (from 1′′.76 on the first night
to 0′′.62 by the third night). If the behavior of the SA
signal is due to emission from a CPD around the ob-
ject observed by Currie et al. (2022) at a PA∼180◦, it
is possible that more of the emission from this source
was captured in the slit on the first night than on subse-
quent nights explaining why the effect was larger when
the slit was misaligned with the candidate planet by 30◦
on night 1 than when the slit was misaligned with the

model used to fit the profile and SA signal for the slit aligned with the semi-major axis of the disk (PA=60◦) was applied for two other
PAs. While the profile could be fit reasonably well, the SA signal diverged significantly from the model. One way to account for this is for
a non-axisymmetric source of emission on the southern part of the disk.

circumstellar disk.

The line profile and SA signals of AB Aur, CQ Tau,
and V892 Tau cannot be fit with a simple disk model.
Some other non-axisymmetric component is necessary
beyond that caused by eccentricity. In principle, emission
from a CPD could account for the SA signal of AB Aur
similarly to what observed in HD 100546 (e.g., Brittain
et al. 2019). Alternatively, a vortex at a large distance
or a disk wind could account for the line profile and ob-
served SA signal (Table 1). These three scenarios can be
distinguished with further observations and is the subject
of ongoing work.

As noted above, CQ Tau has been hypothesized to har-
bor a 6-9 MJup planet 20 au from the star based on struc-
tures in the disk (Ubeira Gabellini et al. 2019). If so, it is
unlikely to affect the broad component of the molecular
emission profile as the emission only extends to ∼10 au.
Given the large eccentricity necessary to account for the
observed line asymmetry, it is possible that CQ Tau har-
bors a close-in (sub-)stellar mass companion. The non-
variable narrow component whose emission is extended
along the slit when it is aligned with the semi-major re-
mains a mystery. The line does not appear to shift more
than 1 km s−1 over two years. However, if it arises from
a CPD orbiting the star at 20 au, the orbital phase of
the companion would only shift 10◦ resulting in a pro-
jected Doppler shift below our detection threshold. An
alternative explanation for the narrow component and
SA signal is a low-velocity disk wind. However, the ex-
tension of the SA signal is a maximum when the slit is
oriented near the semi-major axis, and it is not detected
when the slit is aligned with the semi-minor axis in con-
flict with what is expected for low-velocity disk winds
(Pontoppidan et al. 2011). The broad component of the
spectral profile is the more variable of the two, but the
narrow SA signal also appears to be variable as well. The
complexity of the profiles over our three epochs makes it
difficult to infer the distribution of the gas giving rise to
these phenomena. Measuring the line profile at multiple
PAs in a single night as well as long term monitoring may
clarify the origin of the SA signal.

V892 Tau is an equal mass binary, and the dust compo-
nent of the circumbinary disk extends into ∼17 au (Mon-
nier et al. 2008). The wings of the CO profile indicate
that the gas extends into about 7 au - substantially in-
ward of the inner edge of the dust component of the
circumbinary disk. The orbital period of the gas at 7 au
is 8 years, so the observations presented in this paper,
spaced by 1 year, correspond to an orbital shift in the
disk of 45◦. With just three epochs, it is impossible to
infer whether the CO lines vary stochastically on an or-
bital timescale. Observations are planned to monitor this
object over six months and consecutive nights to better
constrain the timescale of the variability.

7. CONCLUSIONS
SA combined with high resolution spectroscopy of
warm molecules in disks provides a powerful probe of
the conditions of gas in the disk. We find that warm
molecular emission can extend 10’s of au from Herbig
stars. Our sample was selected on the basis of various
signposts of a companion (e.g., spiral structure or gaps).
Four of our nine sources have asymmetric line profiles
that can be fit assuming that the emission arises from

gas on an eccentric orbit indicative of companions near
the inner edge of the disk. HD 169142 is nearly face-on
so the emission is only marginally resolved at our reso-
lution of 3.5 km s−1. A candidate planet was identified
after our observations were acquired, and our slit orien-
tation was not favorably aligned to detect emission from
this companion. While AB Aur has a symmetric pro-
file, the SA signal indicates non-axisymmetric structure
in the outer disk. The origin of this structure will be
tested with further observations. The SNR of IRS 48
and SR 21 are insufficient to place strong constraints on
the eccentricity of the disk. Deeper observations at sim-
ilar resolutions with instruments such as CRIRES+ on
the VLT will provide stronger constraints on any line
asymmetry. CQ Tau reveals a complex line profile. The
broad component varies significantly and does not reveal
an SA signal. The narrow component is less variable, and
it is extended. The origin of these components remain
unclear. V892 Tau is an equal mass binary for which the
CO line profile and SA signal is highly variable. Monitor-
ing of this object will clarify the cadence of the variability
and thus possibly the origin of the emission. LkHα 330
has a complex profile that indicates that the argument
of periapse of the eccentricity flips. The profile is also
variable. A higher fidelity line profile and modeling that
allows for the argument of periapse to flip may indicate
the presence of a companion embedded in the disk.

CQ Tau and AB Aur individually represent interesting
signals warranting continued observation in the context
of potentially planet-harboring disks. However, they also
are worthwhile testbeds for the use of SA to distinguish
between such an origin as well as other scenarios such
as disk winds. Winds in particular can have coinciden-
tally similar spectral and SA signals in single epochs,
but can vary drastically at other times and on different
variability timescales (orbital timescales for planets or
CPDs, stochastic timescales for winds). Continued in-
vestigation and monitoring of these and similar sources
may result in better methods for determining the origin
of the emission.

The sample presented here suggests that disks with an
eccentric component are common among Herbigs with
evidence of ongoing planet formation. Confirmation of
our interpretation will provide a way to gain statistical
information about giant planets in disks in large sam-
ple of stars at distances too far to detect such objects
with direct imaging. New and upcoming instruments
(e.g. METIS, Brandl et al. 2008) on 30m class telescopes
will be able to provide improved observations of this kind
by providing a sensitivity increase by an order of magni-
tude.
