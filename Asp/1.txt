In this proceedings, we study the possible gravitational impact of primordial black holes
(PBHs) or dark matter (DM) clumps on GNSS satellite orbits and gravimeter measurements.
It provides a preliminary step to the future exhaustive statistical analysis over 28 years of
gravimeter and GNSS data to get constraints over the density of asteroid-mass PBH and DM
clumps inside the solar system. Such constraints would be the first to be obtained by direct
observation on a terrestrial scale.

1 Introduction

Whereas there are multiple indirect probes of the existence of Dark Matter (DM) from galactic
to cosmological scales, there is no observational evidence coming from smaller scales.
It is
plausible that DM sub-galactic clusters fragments into smaller parts, referred here as DM clumps.
There are various theoretical scenarios in which a significant fraction of DM is made of dark
objects: primordial black holes (PBHs)1,2, dark quark nuggets or strangelets 3, dark blobs or
other composite states 4,5, axion or scalar miniclusters 6,7, axion 8,9 or boson stars 10,11... This
work focuses on DM clumps with a mass between 1010 to 1020 kg. This mass range is relevant
because microlensing of stars becomes ineffective in detecting compact DM objects below 10−19
kg 12. For what concern the PBHs, a suspected mass threshold of 1011 kg comes from their
evaporation through Hawking radiation 13. As those DM clumps travel in our galaxy, they
eventually pass through the Solar System (SS), itself in motion around the Galactic center.
In this work, we propose for the first time to jointly exploit gravimetry and global navigation
satellite systems (GNSS) data in order to track anomalies in the gravitational potential induced
by DM clumps passing sufficiently near the Earth. For GNSS, this is the first study addressing
their direct gravitational influence on the satellite orbits. For gravimeters, we investigate the
case of transient signatures whereas previous work only focused on the periodic signatures 14.

2 DM clump and PBH in the solar system

Our modeling of events rate is based on the usual value of the DM density in the SS neigh-
bourhood, ρDM ≃ 0.4 GeV/cm3. However, our analysis goes beyond simple approximations of
a constant DM flux, by performing Monte-Carlo simulations of a realistic population of DM
clumps with asteroid masses and by numerically integrating their trajectories in the SS. Their
orbital motion is modeled as Keplerian, using a semi-analytical approach. Only two input pa-
rameters are sufficient to fully define the 2D orbit: the impact parameter B and the hyperbolic

 
 
 
 
 
 
excess velocity V∞. Finally, the event rate and the phase space density close to the Earth are
determined from the output parameters which are: the fly-by distance d, the relative velocity
VDM/C at the distance d, and the clump mass mDM. Fig. 1 shows the output of our MC simu-
lation in terms of d and the distribution of VDM/C. The associated mass flux ˙mDM is presented
as a heat-map. Given that a model of point mass has been introduced, the notion of mass flux
is independent of an underlying model for DM halo fragmentation. Indeed for example, a mass
flux of 1010 kg/year cannot be distinguished from a single clump with a mass of 1012 kg every
century at the same flyby distance d.

3 Signature on GNSS and superconducting Gravimeters

3.1 GNSS

Our modeling shows that any change in the gravitational potential induced by a DM clump
should affect satellite orbits. We carried out a numerical computation of the gravitational signal
caused by the DM clump on GNSS satellites, using the acceleration δ⃗ac(t) in a third-body
perturbation. This simulation is performed by propagating in time a 3D Keplerian osculating
orbit for the GNSS satellite and one 3D unperturbed hyperbolic orbit for the DM object. Given
these orbital paths, the orbit perturbation on GNSS satellite reads:

δ⃗ac(t)
g⊕(t)

= −

µDM
g⊕(t)

(cid:18) ⃗r − ⃗rDM
||⃗r − ⃗rDM||3 +

⃗rDM
||⃗rDM||3

(cid:19)

,

(1)

where ⃗r and ⃗rDM are the positions of the GNSS satellite and DM Clump respectively, µDM is
the DM celestial parameter and g⊕(t) is the reference gravity field. The subsequent deviation
of the GNSS reference orbit is performed by updating the Keplerian elements using Gauss’
variational equations15. The semi-major axis a is chosen as observable since it is the most
sensitive parameter:

where µ⊕ refers to the Earth’s celestial parameter, ⃗r0(t) is the initial reference orbit, h is the
orbital angular momentum, e is the eccentricity, θ is the true anomaly and (˜ar,˜aθ) are the radial
and tangential components within the satellite frame of the satellite acceleration caused by the
perturbation. The signature of a DM clump flyby on the Galileo Constellation is modeled in
Fig. 2 (left), using a as observable. The signal is a characteristic impulse, slightly dephased for
each satellite, with a maximum near the Earth closest approach. Thanks to networks of fixed

permanent GNSS stations, it is possible to determine the GNSS satellites orbit at the cm level.
Such products are made available by e.g. the analysis center CODE16 for the International GNSS
service (IGS). Fig. 2 (right) shows power spectral densities (PSD) of the semi-major axis of each
GNSS satellite (solid lines), in combination with simulated events of duration ∆tDM using DM
clumps model orbits, with different values for BC and V∞.

3.2 Superconducting gravimeters (SG)

For SG, the perturbation induced by a transient DM clump is measured as the radial component
of the third-body perturbation. For flybys outside of the Earth, the relation for the third-body
acceleration is similar to the one found for GNSS satellites (1). Fly-bys inside of Earth occur
when the Earth closest approach d of the clump orbit is smaller than the Earth’s radius. In that
case, the time-dependent normalised gravimeter reading is computed as:

δgr(t)

(3)

where ⃗rg is the position of the gravimeter and ⃗rDM(t) is the modeled hyperbolic orbit. It is also
assumed that mDM << Menc where Menc(r) is the Earth’s enclosed mass at the radial distance
rDM. Two effects may be distinguished in (3). The first one is a recoil of the Earth’s center of
mass, d2XC/dt2. The second effect is the actual acceleration caused by the DM clump. The
signature of a DM clump flyby on the gravimeter residuals is modeled in Fig. 3 using a worldwide
network of 9 gravimeters. The nature of the perturbation is a transient peak reached near the
Earth closest approach. The level of precision is of the order of 10−11g within 1 minute, where g
is the Earth gravitational acceleration. Fig. 3 (right) shows the PSD of residuals (observation -
tidal variations) time series in the Membach station 17 in Belgium, in combination with simulated
events of duration ∆tDM using DM clumps orbit models, with different values for BC and V∞.

4 First results

A preliminary analysis based on the PSD of the gravimeter residuals and Galileo orbital solutions
provides a first assessment of the ‘one-probe’, i.e. one satellite or one gravimeter, sensitivity.
This sensitivity is determined by the overlapping area between the PSD and the simulated events
in Fig. 2 and 3. Focusing on GNSS, Fig. 4 relates the single-satellite sensitivity (blue dots) to a
minimum clump mass and a corresponding flyby distance. The ratio with our simulated event
rates (orange dots, Fig. 4) is around 6 orders of magnitude, so that a single probe is not enough
to hope a detection. However, this single probe analysis paves the way for a future statistical

km, V∞ = 300 km/s and iDM = 0 deg. Right: Physical envelope of the max. |δgr/g|, realised for 9 excess velocities
ranging from 2.5 km/s to 600 km/s associated to 20 values for BC in the range [10−4- 10−2] AU. Added to the
latter is the Membach station σP SD/g (blue) with an additional 1/
N correction factor (Orange), where N is
the number of gravimeters.

analysis based on correlations between a constellation of probes using the 28-years of publicly
available GNSS and gravimeter data. Such a statistical analysis would enable to gain between
2 and 3 orders of magnitude in sensitivity (dashed blue line, Fig. 4).

Finally, our one-probe sensitivity implies a state of equilibrium with a total DM clump mass
of less than 0.1 Ceres mass in a 1.5 AU sphere around the Sun. This one-probe results would not
compete with the bounds based from space probes and planet ephemeris in the SS 18. However,
these latter limits apply only to a permanent cloud of particles in the SS and are not transferable
to transient DM clumps. Anyway, a full statistical analysis of GNSS and SG data would surpass
the limits based on SS ephemeris 18 by at least one order of magnitude. Hence, such constraints
would be the first and the best to be obtained by direct observation on a terrestrial scale, before
LISA is operational 19.
