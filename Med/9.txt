Abstract

  Background—Diabetes, heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common 
co-morbidities, but overall use and safety of anti-hyperglycemic medications (AHM) among 
patients with these co-morbidities are poorly understood.

  Methods and Results—Using Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) and 
linked Medicare Part D data, we assessed AHM use within 90 days of hospital discharge among 
HF patients with diabetes discharged from GWTG-HF hospitals between 1-1-2006 and 10-1-2011. 
We further summarized use by renal function and assessed renal contraindicated AHM use for 
patients with eGFR <30mL/min/1.73m2. Among 8,791 patients meeting inclusion criteria, the 
median age was 77 (interquartile range [IQR] 71-83), 62.3% were female, median BMI was 29.7 
(IQR 25.5-35.3), median HbA1c was 6.8 (IQR 6.2-7.8), and 34% had ejection fraction <40%. 
74.9% of patients filled a prescription for an AHM, with insulin (39.5%), sulfonylureas (32.4%), 
and metformin (17%) being the most commonly used AHMs. Insulin use was higher and 
sulfonylurea/metformin use was lower among patients with lower renal function classes. Among 
1,512 patients with eGFR <30mL/min/1.73m2, 35.4% filled prescriptions for renal contraindicated 
AHMs per prescribing information, though there was a trend toward lower renal contraindicated 
AHM use over time (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel row-mean score test p=0.048). While use of other 
AHMs was low overall, thiazolidinediones were used in 6.6% of HF patients and DPP4-inhibitors 
were used in 5.1%, with trends for decreasing thiazolidinedione use and increased DPP4-inhibitor 
use over time (p<0.001).

  Conclusions—Treatment of diabetes in patients with HF and CKD disease is complex, and 
these patients are commonly treated with renal contraindicated AHMs, including over 6% 
receiving a thiazolidinedione despite known concerns regarding heart failure. More research 
regarding safety and efficacy of various AHMs among HF patients is needed.

Keywords

heart failure; diabetes mellitus; chronic kidney disease

Diabetes is common among heart failure patients, occurring in 28-44% of heart failure 
patients, and is associated with adverse outcomes regardless of ejection fraction, including 
increased risk of both cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization.1-3 Despite the 
high prevalence of comorbid heart failure and diabetes, there are few randomized clinical 
trial data to inform the management of diabetes among patients with heart failure.4

While improved glucose control is associated with fewer microvascular complications from 
diabetes, clinicians must balance these potential benefits with the risk of adverse effects 
from anti-hyperglycemic medications (AHMs). For example, hypoglycemic episodes are 
more frequent among heart failure patients with diabetes than in patients without heart 
failure, and certain AHMs such as thiazolidinediones and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) 
inhibitors may increase the risk of heart failure, which led the Food and Drug 
Administration to consider manufacturer labelling outlining this risk.5-8 For the DPP-4 
inhibitor saxagliptin in particular, the risk of heart failure may increase with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD), which is present in up to half of ambulatory patients with heart failure, 
though the drug has been studied and does not appear to increase ischemic events in patients 
with renal insufficiency.9, 10

The treatment of diabetes in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) 
presents a particular challenge since nearly 2/3 of these patients have impaired renal 
function, which affects the safety of many AHMs used in the treatment of diabetes.11, 12 In 
particular, metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, incretin mimetics (glucagon-like 
peptide-1 receptor agonists), DPP4-inhibitors, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors carry 
specific cautions in their prescribing information recommending against use or cautious dose 
adjustment in patients with renal impairment. While impaired renal function is prevalent in 
patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure, it is unclear how this affects 
the choice of AHMs for patients with diabetes. Moreover, the overall use and outcomes 
associated with use of AHMs with renal contraindications among heart failure patients are 
poorly understood. We performed an analysis of Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure 
(GWTG-HF) linked with Medicare claims data to characterize utilization of AHMs after 
hospitalization for heart failure based on renal function.

must receive approval through their local institutional review boards or a waiver of 
individual consent under the common rule. Trained personnel regularly review hospital 
records and identify patients admitted with heart failure. Medical history and demographic 
data are abstracted, and de-identified data are entered into a central database using a web-
based patient management tool. Quintiles (Cambridge, MA) is the data collection 
coordination center for the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association 
GWTG programs. The Duke Clinical Research Institute (Durham, NC) serves as the data 
analysis center and has an agreement to analyze the aggregate, de-identified data for 
research purposes.

  Study Population

Using GWTG-HF, we identified patients with heart failure who had either a prior medical 
history of diabetes or new diagnosis of diabetes established during the index heart failure 
hospitalization and were discharged from hospital between 01/01/2006 and 10/01/2011. 
Patients had to be continuously enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare Part D at 
index discharge and for the 90 days post discharge. Among a total of 61,093 Medicare 
beneficiaries identified in GWTG-HF during this study period, 22,873 (37.4%) had diabetes 
and were discharged prior to 10/1/2011. We excluded patients who died in hospital (n=671), 
transferred out of index hospital (n=587), who were discharged to hospice (n=585), had end 
stage renal disease (n=1387), or had transplant or LVAD implantation during hospitalization 
(n=22). Of the remaining patients, 8,791/19,621 (44.8%) were enrolled in Medicare fee-for-
service and Medicare Part D continuously within the 90 days post index discharge and were 
included in the final study population.

  Statistical Analysis

Patients were classified into three renal function classes (eGFR<30mL/min/1.73m2, 30≤ 
eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2, and eGFR≥60mL/min/1.73m2) using the Modification of Diet in 
Renal Disease (MDRD) formula and serum creatinine on admission to hospital. Percentages 
and medians with 25th and 75th percentiles (IQRs) were reported to describe the distribution 
of categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The patient characteristics, including 
demographics, clinical data, medical history, and hospital characteristics as captured in 
GWTG-HF were compared between the three renal function groups. Pearson Chi-square and 
Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to test the difference for categorical and continuous 
variables.

To assess use of AHMs, we linked GWTG-HF data to Medicare Part D claims to identify 
diabetes medications filled within 90 days of index discharge for heart failure, including 
metformin/biguanide, sulfonylurea, meglitinide, glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, 
DPP4-inhibitor, alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, thiazolidinedione, insulin, and amylin analog. 
For patients with greater than one hospitalization, only the first claim for AHM and its 
corresponding hospitalization and was used for analysis. If multiple claims for one AHM 
class were found within 90 days, that AHM was counted only once. If a patient had claims 
for two or more medications in different AHM classes, for example both insulin and 
metformin, it was counted for each of the AHM classes. AHMs with labeling to avoid or 
reduce dosage in chronic kidney disease were categorized as renal contraindicated AHMs,

including metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, incretin mimetics (GLP-1 agonists), 
DPP4-inhinitors, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Renal contraindicated use was defined as 
the use of a renal contraindicated AHM among patients with eGFR<30mL/min/1.73m2 on 
admission to hospital, as captured in GWTG-HF. The trend in renal contraindicated AHM 
use from 2006 to 2011 was tested using Cochran-Mantel-Haenzsel row-mean score statistic.

A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the factors associated 
with renal contraindicated AHM use among the patients with eGFR<30mL/min/1.73m2. 
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods were used to account for the within-
hospital clustering of patients. The regression model included demographics, age, gender, 
non-Caucasian race, Hispanic ethnicity, prior medical histories (atrial fibrillation/flutter, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], hyperlipidemia, hypertension, peripheral 
vascular disease [PVD], ischemic heart disease including prior myocardial infarction [MI], 
coronary artery disease [CAD], percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], or coronary artery 
bypass grafting [CABG], cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack [CVA/TIA], 
implantable-cardioverter defibrillator [ICD], heart failure, anemia, pacemaker, renal 
insufficiency, depression and smoking history in past 6 months), ejection fraction, BMI, 
respiratory rate at admission and heart rate, systolic blood pressure at discharge, sodium, 
eGFR, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hemoglobin at admission, and potassium at discharge, 
length of stay, and hospital characteristics, including region, number of beds, rural (vs. 
urban) location, and hospitals teaching status. Most variables had missing rate less than 5% 
except Hispanic ethnicity had 12% missing and BMI had 13% missing and potassium had 
16% missing. Therefore, multiple imputation was used to address missing variables.

A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. All analyses were 
performed with SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Among 8,791 Medicare patients with heart failure and diabetes included in our study, the 
median age was 77 (IQR 71-83), 62.3% female, with median EF 47% (IQR 30-60). The 
median BMI was 29.7 (IQR 25.5-35.3) and median HbA1c was 6.8 (IQR 6.2-7.8). In this 
cohort, 17.2% had eGFR<30mL/min/1.73m2, 49.1% had 30≤ eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2, and 
32.5% had eGFR≥60mL/min/1.73m2 (Table 1). Patients in lower renal function classes 
included higher proportion of females (71.1 vs. 64.9 vs. 53.6, p<0.001), more patients with 
multiple comorbidities (4 vs. 3 vs. 3, p<0.001), lower proportion of patients with reduced 
ejection fraction (30.4 vs. 33.7 vs. 36.2, p=0.001), and slightly longer lengths of stay (5 
(IQR 3-7.5) vs. 4 (IQR 3-7) vs. 4 (IQR 3-6), p<0.001).

AHM use varied considerably by renal function (Table 2). The proportion of patients filling 
prescriptions for insulin, which is generally used as monotherapy, was higher among patients 
with more severe renal dysfunction (47.4% vs. 40.9% vs. 33%, p<0.001 among patients with 
eGFR<30mL/min/1.73m2 vs. 30≤ eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2 vs. eGFR≥60mL/min/1.73m2, 
respectively). In contrast, metformin use (3.5% vs. 13.5% vs. 29.5%) and sulfonylurea use 
(26.9% vs. 34.3% vs. 32.9%) was lower among patients with more severe renal dysfunction. 
Prescription fills for other AHMs were low overall, though thiazolidinediones were

surprisingly used in 6.6% of patients with heart failure despite the known risk for worsening 
heart failure. DPP-4 inhibitors were likewise used in 5.1% of patients overall, though there 
was a trend towards increased use of DPP-4 inhibitors and decreased use of 
thiazolidinediones among all patients over time (p<0.001) (Figure 1).

Among 1,512 patients with eGFR<30mL/min/1.73m2, 35.4% received renal contraindicated 
AHMs, though there was a trend toward less renal contraindicated AHM use over time 
during the study period (p=0.048) (Figure 2A). In particular, there was a temporal trend 
towards less sulfonylurea use (p=0.005), more DPP-4 inhibitor use (p<0.001) and less 
thiazolidinedione use (p<0.001) (Figure 2B). The proportion of patients with a prior history 
of insulin treated diabetes was lower (32.3% vs. 65.3%, p<0.001) and age slightly higher (77 
(IQR 72-84) vs. 76 (IQR 70-83), p<0.005) among patients receiving renal contraindicated 
AHMs compared to those not (Table 3). There was also a slightly higher HbA1c (6.9 (IQR 
6.2-7.7) vs. 6.6 (IQR 6-7.3), p=0.030) and slightly greater proportion of patients with low 
ejection fraction among patients receiving renal contraindicated AHMs (33.6% vs. 28.7%, 
p=0.049). Surprisingly, patients receiving renal contraindicated AHMs had less number of 
comorbidities (p=0.03). Among hospital characteristics, only hospital region showed an 
association with renal contraindicated AHM use. We performed a multivariable logistic 
regression analysis to identify independent predictors of renal contraindicated AHM use, but 
no clinically meaningful variables were found to have clear association with renal 
contraindicated AHM use (Supplement Table).

  Discussion

In this study, we have reported novel data regarding usage patterns of AHMs among 
Medicare patients with heart failure and diabetes. AHMs are used in ∼75% of patients with 
heart failure and diabetes, with insulin being the most commonly prescribed medication 
regardless of renal function class, followed by sulfonylureas and metformin. Moreover, we 
show that AHMs that may worsen heart failure, including thiazolidinediones and potentially 
some DPP4-inhibitors based on data that emerged after the study period, are used in one-
tenth of patients with heart failure and that over one-third of patients with eGFR 
<30mL/min/1.73m2 are treated with renal contraindicated AHMs. There were strikingly few 
differences among patients receiving renal contraindicated AHMs vs. not receiving renal 
contraindicated AHMs among patients with eGFR<30mL/min/1.73m2, suggesting that 
provider choices, rather than patient factors, may be driving these prescribing patterns.

Current guidelines provide little guidance for managing complex comorbidities such as 
diabetes and chronic kidney disease in heart failure patients, reflecting the relatively paucity 
of data regarding management of these complex comorbidities. Where data are lacking, 
safety is generally the primary driver for prescribing, yet we showed that 35.4% of 
prescriptions for AHMs among patients with diabetes and eGFR<30mL/min/1.73m2 are 
renal contraindicated, thereby potentially exposing patients to a higher risk of adverse 
events, particularly hypoglycemia. We suspect this reflects a lack of awareness regarding the 
safe use of various AHM classes among patients with diabetes and CKD. Moreover, we 
observed an approximate 10% prescription rate for AHMs that may worsen heart failure. 
While data regarding the potential increased risk of heart failure with the DPP-4 inhibitor

saxagliptin did not emerge until 2013, data regarding the heart failure risk with 
thiazolidinediones was available throughout most of the study period.7, 15

The impact of renal contraindicated AHM prescription on healthcare utilization and 
outcomes are poorly understood and need further investigation. This is particularly 
important because heart failure patients are prone to fluctuations in renal function because 
neurohormonal and hemodynamic derangements, volume status, and even the medicines 
used to treat heart failure or concomitant comorbidities can have significant effects on renal 
function and clearance of AHMs. While it is possible that renal contraindicated AHMs were 
being used as a strategy to obtain better glycemic control (Hba1c 6.9 vs. 6.6 among patients 
with renal contraindicated AHM vs. not), glycemic control was good overall and data is 
mixed regarding blood glucose control and heart failure outcomes. Though some data 
suggest improvement in diastolic dysfunction with enhanced blood glucose control, large 
randomized trials have shown higher risks of hypoglycemia with intensive blood glucose 
control strategies without improvements in macrovascular outcomes or incident heart 
failure.18-20 As such, we need more data to guide diabetes management strategies for 
patients with heart failure, including specific glycemic control targets and recommendations 
for medication choices, especially among patients with CKD who are prone to adverse 
medication effects from renal contraindicated AHMs.

Unfortunately, the optimal diabetes treatment strategy among patients with heart failure is 
unclear, even among patients without CKD. Thiazolidinediones have been shown to increase 
risk of heart failure in case reports from as early as 2002, which has been supported by 
clinical trial and observational data and led to an FDA issued black box warning in 2007 
against their use in heart failure patients.5, 21-24 Observational studies suggest that insulin 
and sulfonylureas may be associated with higher risks for fluid retention and heart failure 
respectively, and the initial results of the FIGHT trial suggest that liraglutide provides no 
cardiovascular outcome benefit to heart failure patients.25-27 Recently, heart failure risk with 
DPP4 inhibitors has been rigorously studied, with one study showing no increased risk of 
heart failure (TECOS – Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin) and two 
showing neutral to higher risk (EXAMINE – Examination of cArdiovascular outcoMes with 
alogliptIN vs standard of carE in patients with type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndrome 
and SAVOR-TIMI 53 – Saxagliptin Assesment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients 
with Diabetes Mellitus).8, 28, 29 These studies did not specifically enroll heart failure 
patients, and the TECOS trial excluded patients with eGFR <30mL/min/1.73m2. 
Nevertheless, for saxagliptin patients with CKD had a greater risk for heart failure.7, 8 
Metformin potentially has the best observational data supporting its use in heart failure 
patients, but it continues to carry warnings against its use in CKD patients despite evidence 
suggesting it may be cautiously used in setting of mild to moderate CKD.30, 31 
Unfortunately there is little data on how CKD affects heart failure risk among other AHMs. 
While choice of an optimal AHM in heart failure patients is not straightforward, it should be 
noted that thiazolidinediones were prescribed in ≥3% of patients during the last two years of 
our study despite strong evidence against their use. Moreover, 32.3% of patients who 
received renal contraindicated AHMs were also prescribed insulin.

Despite a growing body of knowledge addressing the complex interplay between metabolic 
derangements of heart failure and diabetes, a safe and effective AHM remains elusive.32, 33 
The SGLT-1 inhibitor empaglaflozin may be promising based on the recent results of 
EMPA-REG trial, which showed a lower risk of heart failure hospitalization (hazard ratio 
0.65) and death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio 0.62).34 Unfortunately, SGLT-1 
inhibitor use was not assessed in this study because it was not FDA approved during the 
study period. Additional studies are underway to assess cardiovascular outcomes with nearly 
all classes of AHMs.35 Nevertheless, these trials are not specifically designed to recruit heart 
failure patients and many limit enrollment of patients with CKD, so we believe there need to 
be more dedicated trials of AHMs specifically for heart failure patients with complex 
comorbidities such as CKD.

This study has a number of limitations that must be mentioned. GWTG-HF is a voluntary 
quality improvement program and may not represent prescribing patterns at non-
participating hospitals. Also, care for patients with Medicare and Part D may differ from 
care of younger patients in different care settings. It is possible that renal function at baseline 
in our patients with acute decompensated heart failure did not reflect baseline outpatient 
renal function; nevertheless we believe that our results are still applicable to a broad 
population of patients because labile renal function should itself be considered when 
prescribing AHMs with renal contraindications to mitigate risks of adverse drug effects. In 
addition, AHM use was assessed in the first 90 days after hospital discharge. We were 
therefore unable to capture if AHM therapy was altered by outpatient providers after this 
time frame or if patients continued to fill prescriptions for AHMs. It should be noted that 
nearly one quarter of patients failed to fill a prescription for AHM regardless of renal 
function class, which could signify either lack of adherence, diet-control, or sufficient pre-
existing supply of AHMs. Due to limitations of data, we are unable to identify whether 
factors that are not captured in GWTG-HF may have affected choice and safety of AHMs 
used to treat patients in this study. Lastly, these data are observational and hypothesis 
generating. While nearly one-third of AHMs prescribed among patients with eGFR 
<30mL/min/1.73m2 have renal contraindications, further research is needed to assess how 
this affects outcomes.

In conclusion, AHMs are used in a majority of patients with heart failure and diabetes, 
though a considerable proportion of prescriptions are renal contraindicated or thought to 
exacerbate heart failure. There is a strong need to increase awareness among both providers 
and patients to prevent and investigate the incidence and impact of adverse events based on 
these prescribing patterns. Moreover, there are few data to guide management of diabetes in 
the setting of comorbid heart failure and CKD. Future clinical trials are needed to assess 
outcomes among patients receiving specific classes of AHMs, including renal 
contraindicated AHMs.

Clinical Perspective

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease are common comorbidities among heart failure 
patients and are associated with adverse outcomes including death and heart failure 
hospitalization. This is particularly challenging because many anti-hyperglycemic 
medications (AHMs) including metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, incretin mimetics 
(glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists), DPP4-inhibitors, and alpha-glucosidase 
inhibitors carry specific cautions in their prescribing information recommending against 
use or cautious dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. We used Get With The 
Guidelines Heart Failure and Medicare Part D to study and report novel data regarding 
AHM prescribing patterns among heart failure patients with diabetes and CKD. We found 
that 75% of patients with heart failure and diabetes were treated with AHMs, and that 
over one-third of patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30mL/min/
1.73m2 were treated with renal contraindicated AHMs. This may reflect a lack of 
awareness regarding the safe use of various AHM classes among patients with diabetes 
and CKD and could potentially expose patients to a higher risk of adverse events, 
particularly hypoglycemia. There is a strong need to increase awareness among both 
providers and patients to prevent and investigate the impact of renal contraindicated 
AHM prescriptions on healthcare utilization and outcomes. Moreover, there is little 
randomized data to guide management of diabetes in heart failure patients, and there need 
to be more dedicated trials of AHMs specifically for heart failure patients, including 
patients with complex comorbidities such as CKD.
