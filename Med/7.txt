Abstract
Introduction: Galectin-3 is a multifunctional protein, the lev-
els of which increase in the presence of diseases that prog-
ress with pulmonary fibrosis. This study investigated the role 
of galectin-3 levels in the staging and assessing of the sever-
ity of sarcoidosis. Methods and Subjects: Seventy-three sub-
jects were studied; 25 were healthy individuals and 48 pa-
tients had pathologically confirmed diagnosis of sarcoidosis 
in which other potential causes had been ruled out. Galec-
tin-3 levels were measured and compared in terms of such 
parameters as hemogram, biochemistry, age, body mass in-
dex, and smoking status. Results: The mean galectin-3 levels 
of the sarcoidosis patients (14.87 ± 5.57) were significantly 
higher than those in the healthy subjects (11.81 ± 2.67), and 
the mean galectin-3 levels differed significantly among dif-
ferent stages of the disease (p < 0.05). The serum galectin-3 
level in patients with stage 2, 3, and 4 sarcoidosis was found 

to be higher than in patients with stage 0 and 1 sarcoidosis 
and the control group. In addition, serum galectin-3 levels in 
the sarcoidosis patients had significant positive correlations 
with blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, white blood 
cells,  red  blood  cell,  hemoglobin,  and  neutrophil  levels 
(34.9% [p < 0.05]; 40.1% [p < 0.05]; 41.2% [p < 0.01]; 43.3% [p 
< 0.01]; 34.7% [p < 0.05]; and 40.6% [p < 0.01], respectively) 
and a significant negative correlation with the platelet distri-
bution width levels (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Serum galectin-3 
levels are significantly elevated in sarcoidosis patients with 
parenchymal involvement at stage 2 or higher, suggesting 
that serum galectin-3 levels can be used to estimate disease 
severity in sarcoidosis.

0.1–81 per 100,000 and prevalence has been reported as 
0.1–640 per 100,000. The prognosis and course of the dis-
ease may be consistent with its mode of onset and extent 
[1–3].  While  various  parameters  for  monitoring  the 
course of the disease have been investigated, a specific bio-
marker has yet to be identified. Several parameters have 
been investigated to predict the activity of sarcoidosis, in-
cluding  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  and  adenosine 
deaminase levels, lysozyme, neopterin, β2 microglobulin, 
hypergammaglobulinemia, Krebs von den Lungen-6, chi-
totriosidas, fibronectin, collagenase, hyaluronan, and fi-
bronectin levels [4, 5]. Two studies have shown that the 
Krebs  von  den  Lungen-6  and  chitotriosidas  biomarkers 
can be used to determine the severity of sarcoidosis [6, 7].
Galectin-3 is a β-galactoside-binding animal lectin that 
has sites of carbohydrate recognition [8, 9]. Galectin-3 is 
released from the cytoplasm or nucleus of various cell types, 
including but not limited to, monocytes (MONs), macro-
phages, and endothelial, microglia, and epithelial cells [10]. 
Galectin-3 is a multifunctional protein that is involved in 
various physiological and pathologic processes, such as cell 
growth,  angiogenesis,  carcinogenesis,  and  inflammation. 
Extracellular galectin-3 mediates inflammation and leuko-
cyte adhesion and plays roles in the retrieval and activation 
of neutrophils (NEUs) [11] and also has a crucial role in the 
stimulation of inflammation in a wide range of acute and 
chronic events, particularly neurologic degeneration, auto-
immune  disorders,  atherosclerosis  and  heart  failure,  and 
response to infections or diseases of the lungs, kidney, and 
liver [12]. A recent study by Sun et al. [13] showed a rela-
tionship  between  galectin-3  level  and  prognosis  of  acute 
kidney injury. These observations suggest that galectin-3 
may result in fibrosis in several systems.

Increased levels of serum galectin-3 in the presence of 
diseases  progressing  with  pulmonary  fibrosis  have  been 
reported [14]. Taking into account the limited number of 
studies investigating the relationship between galectin-3 
levels  and  pulmonary  diseases,  some  of  which  reported 
significant findings in the presence of pulmonary fibrosis, 
we hypothesized that serum galectin-3 may be used as a 
biomarker  for  the  staging  and  assessment  of  severity  of 
sarcoidosis. In the present study, we investigated the levels 
of galectin-3 in sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls.

Subjects and Methods

The present study included patients aged between 18 and 75 
years who were followed in our hospital and diagnosed with pul-
monary  sarcoidosis  after  other  potential  causes  were  ruled  out. 
The inducted patients had the following features: they had histo-

pathological evidence of granuloma without calcification necrosis; 
they did not have interstitial lung disease other than sarcoidosis, 
or organ malignancy or history of chronic disorders. They made 
regular  outpatient  clinic  visits  and  agreed  to  participate  in  the 
study. Healthy subjects aged between 18 and 75 years with no his-
tory of chronic disease and who voluntarily agreed to participate 
in the study constituted the control group. The study was initiated 
after approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of our hospi-
tal (Research Protocol Number 4221). The patients were informed 
about the study, and all signed an informed consent form.

The following data were garnered and evaluated for the 48 pa-
tients who agreed to participate in the study: demographic charac-
teristics (age, gender, height, weight, and smoking status), pulmo-
nary  function  test  results,  methods  of  diagnosis,  current  treat-
ments, presence of extrapulmonary involvement, galectin-3 levels, 
and  results  of  hemogram  and  biochemistry  investigations  per-
formed within the last 6 months, obtained from hospital records.
The following data were recorded and evaluated for the 25 healthy 
controls who agreed to participate in the study: demographic charac-
teristics (age, gender, height, weight, and smoking status), serum ga-
lectin-3 levels, as well as hemogram and biochemistry investigations 
performed within the last 6 months, obtained from hospital records. 
Galectin-3 levels of all sarcoidosis patients (n = 48) were compared 
along with their demographic data, pulmonary function test results, 
current  treatments  (if  any),  presence  of  extrapulmonary  involve-
ment,  and  hemogram  and  biochemistry  investigations  performed 
within the last 6 months, which were obtained from hospital records. 
Galectin-3 levels of all the healthy controls (n = 25) were compared 
along with their demographical data, body mass index (BMI), smok-
ing  status,  and  hemogram  and  biochemistry  investigations  per-
formed within the last 6 months, obtained from hospital records.

Blood  samples  were  obtained  from  both  groups  and  centri-
fuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Serum samples were stored 
in Eppendorf tubes at −21 to −40°C. Galectin-3 levels in the serum 
samples were measured using a commercial kit based on the ELISA 
method (eBioscience, catalog no: BMS279/4, lot no: 133218001).

Based  on  the  hemogram  results  of  the  peripheral  blood,  the 
NEU lymphocyte (LYM) ratio was calculated by dividing the ab-
solute NEU count by the absolute LYM count, and the thrombo-
cyte LYM ratio was calculated by dividing the absolute thrombo-
cyte count by the absolute LYM count. Radiological classification 
was carried out by two different blinded pulmonologists, following 
the Scadding stage system, and classification difference between 
the specialists was detected using the Kappa method.

Numerical data were evaluated using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23 
program, and measures of central tendency were presented as mean, 
standard  deviation,  minimum,  and  maximum  values.  Frequency 
distribution of the categorical variables was presented. An indepen-
dent samples t test was used to evaluate the differences between the 
2 groups, and a one-way variance analysis (ANOVA) was used to 
assess the potential differences between more than 2 groups. Based 
on the results of the ANOVA, a Levene’s test was applied to assess 
the homogeneity of variances, and a multiple comparison test (Bon-
ferroni or Tamhane’s T2) was carried out to identify the group(s) 
causing significant difference. The differences between the groups 
were investigated with a Bonferroni test for variables with homoge-
neous variances and with Tamhane’s T2 test for variables without 
homogeneous variances. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was 
used to investigate the relationship between serum galectin-3 levels, 
clinical characteristics, and blood parameters.

Results

Seventy-three cases were included in this; 65.8% (n = 
48) had been diagnosed with sarcoidosis and 34.2% (n = 
25) were healthy controls; 58.9% (n = 43) of all subjects 
were female and 41.1% (n = 30) were male. Women and 
men accounted for 62.5% (n = 30) and 37.5% (n = 18) of 
the sarcoidosis patients, while in the control group 50% 
(n = 13) of the cases were male and 50% (n = 13) were fe-
male. The mean age of the entire study population was 
42.11 ± 12.29 (20–67) years, while mean age of the patient 
and control groups was 45.21 ± 11.90 (23–67) and 36.16 
± 10.953 (20–64) years, respectively.

Of  all  subjects,  49.30%  (n  =  36)  were  smokers  and 
50.70% (n = 37) had never smoked; smokers and those 
who had never smoked constituted 41.10% (n = 20) and 
58.30% (n = 28) of the patient group and 46.15% (n = 

12) and 38.40% (n = 10) of the control group, respec-
tively.

The staging of the patients according to Scadding stag-
ing was as follows: stage 0 patients 25% (n = 12), stage 1 
patients 35.4% (n = 17), stage 2 patients 25% (n = 12), stage 
3 patients 12.5% (n = 6), and stage 4 cases 2.1% (n = 1). Of 
all the patients with sarcoidosis, 58.3% (n = 28) had previ-
ously  undergone  steroid  therapy,  while  21.3%  (n  =  10) 
were actively using steroid therapy while participating in 
the study. In addition, 4.2% (n = 2) of patients were con-
comitantly  receiving  methotrexate  treatment.  Extrapul-
monary involvement was present in 37.5% (n = 18) of sar-
coidosis patients, and eye, skin, and kidney involvement 
was present in 6.25% (n = 3), 31.25% (n = 15), and 8.3% (n 
= 4) of the patients, respectively. Of all the patients, 2.08% 
(n = 1) had concomitant skin and eye involvement, where-
as 4.16% (n = 2) had both skin and kidney involvement.

An independent samples t test showed that mean ga-
lectin-3 levels, age, BMI, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric 
acid,  lactate  dehydrogenase,  and  sedimentation  values 
were significantly higher in the sarcoidosis patients than 
in  the  healthy  controls  (shown  in  Table  1).  One-way 
ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in 
serum  levels  of  galectin-3  between  sarcoidosis  disease 
stages (p < 0.05) (Table 2). The mean levels of serum ga-

lectin-3  in  the  sarcoidosis  patients  at  stage  2  or  higher 
were significantly higher than those in patients at stage 0 
or 1. The independent samples t test revealed no statisti-

controls,  a  significantly  stronger  relationship  was  ob-
served between the mean serum galectin-3 levels and the 
serum BUN, MON and NEU count, leukocyte and eryth-
rocyte  count,  and  hemoglobin  (HGB)  and  hematocrit

Discussion

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease with 
unknown etiology and progresses with multi-systemic in-
volvement. With a devious onset from asymptomatic bi-
lateral hilar adenopathy to multiple extrapulmonary le-
sions, the disease may result in progressive fibrosis of the 
lungs and other organs. Prognosis and disease course may 
be associated with its mode of onset and its extent [1–3].
In the present study, we found that serum levels of ga-
lectin-3  were  significantly  higher  in  the  sarcoidosis  pa-
tients than in the healthy controls and that the levels were 
particularly elevated in patients at stage 2 or higher (char-
acterized by parenchymal involvement), when compared 
to patients at stage 0 and 1. On the other hand, extrapul-
monary involvement, smoking, age, or BMI was not sig-
nificantly associated with serum galectin-3 levels.

In vitro studies investigating galectin-3 have demon-
strated that the absence of galectin-3 may improve fibrot-
ic response in the kidneys, liver, and lungs [15, 16]. Previ-
ous studies have also reported increased levels of galec-
tin-3  in  diseases  progressing  with  fibrosis,  such  as 
cirrhosis  and  idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis  [13–17].  A 
previous study reported that galectin-3 levels were elevat-
ed in sarcoidosis patients with cardiac involvement when 
compared  to  the  controls  [18].  Another  study  reported 
that  serum  galectin-3  levels  were  similar  in  sarcoidosis 
patients and control groups [19]. These data indicate that 
galectin-3 may result in fibrosis in several organs. In the 
present study, we investigate the role of galectin-3 in the 
staging  and  severity  of  sarcoidosis  that  progresses  with 
fibrosis.

Consistent with the findings of previous studies [14–
18], galectin-3 levels were found to be significantly high-
er  in  sarcoidosis  patients  than  in  the  healthy  controls. 
While galectin-3 levels were compared based on the ra-
diological stages of sarcoidosis, the levels were found to 
be  significantly  higher  in  patients  at  stage  2  or  higher, 
progressing with parenchymal involvement, when com-
pared to the healthy controls, as well as patients with stage 
0 or 1 sarcoidosis who were in remission, and who were 
being followed without treatment. This increase in galec-

tin-3  levels  indicates  that  fibrosis  developed  as  soon  as 
parenchymal  involvement  occurred.  The  detection  of 
high levels of galectin-3 prior to a radiological diagnosis 
of stage 2 can indicate disease progression before radiol-
ogy and may help with early diagnosis, and the consider-
ation  of  alternative  treatments  before  the  full  develop-
ment of pulmonary fibrosis.

We also observed that extrapulmonary involvements 
in such organs as the eye, kidney, and skin did not sig-
nificantly affect galectin-3 levels in sarcoidosis patients. 
Similarly, a previous study reported elevated serum galec-
tin-3 levels in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis when 
compared to the control group but did not point to a sig-
nificant  difference  in  galectin-3  levels  between  patients 
with and without cardiac involvement [18]. The present 
study showed that galectin-3 levels in the sarcoidosis pa-
tients were not significantly affected by smoking status, 
age, gender, BMI, creatinine, serum calcium, lactate de-
hydrogenase, sedimentation, angiotensin-converting en-
zyme,  FEV1%,  FVC%,  24-h  urine  calcium,  NEU,  LYM 
ratio, or thrombocyte LYM ratio. A previous study iden-
tified a significant relationship between serum levels of 
galectin-3 and age and gender, found the levels to be high-
er  in  women  than  men,  and  were  observed  to  increase 
with age, whereas we identified no such relationships in 
the present study [20]. The same study also reported sig-
nificant relationships between galectin-3 levels and BMI, 
kidney function tests, DM, C-reactive protein, and smok-
ing status, while no such relationships were identified to 
any significant degree between galectin-3 levels and these 
parameters in the present study [20]. Similarly, a study 
performed in 2007 reported significantly elevated levels 
of  serum  galectin-3  in  bronchoalveolar  lavage  samples 
obtained  from  patients  with  diseases  progressing  with 
pulmonary  fibrosis,  particularly  in  patients  with  idio-
pathic pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease as-
sociated with connective tissue disorders. Furthermore, 
the galectin-3 levels in patients with interstitial lung dis-
eases associated with connective tissue disorders who un-
derwent steroid treatment were also found to be mildly 
decreased, although this decrease was not statistically sig-
nificant  in  that  study,  contradicting  the  findings  of  the 
present study [14]. This may be attributed to the inclusion 
of a healthy control group and sarcoidosis patients with 
normal renal functions in the present study.

Previous  studies  have  also  reported  a  relationship  be-
tween  high  serum  levels  of  galectin-3  and  prognoses  of 
acute and chronic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, 
and acute coronary syndrome [20, 21]. This suggests that 
serum galectin-3 may also be used as a marker of prognosis

Galectin-3 Levels in SarcoidosisMed Princ Pract 2022;31:59–65DOI: 10.1159/000521467in sarcoidosis patients. The short duration of our study pre-
vented the collection of a sufficient amount of data for the 
investigation of the relationship between serum galectin-3 
levels and prognosis in sarcoidosis patients. We believe that 
future prospective studies will better establish the relation-
ship between serum galectin-3 levels and disease prognosis.
The results of the present study reveal that HGB, he-
matocrit,  red  blood  cell,  white  blood  cells,  MON  and 
NEU values, and BUN levels have a positive effect on se-
rum  galectin-3  levels  in  sarcoidosis  patients,  although 
contrary to our findings, a previous study involving pa-
tients with heart failure found no significant relationship 
between HGB and serum galectin-3 levels [22]. Previous 
studies  have  identified  a  negative  relationship  between 
HGB and inflammation [23]. We believe that the differ-
ences between our findings and those of previous studies 
may be attributed to the fact that the majority of patients 
in the present study were in a stable phase of the disease 
or were in regression.

Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels are detect-
ed in up to 33 percent of sarcoidosis patients, and ALP is 
superior  to  gamma-glutamyl  transferase  in  terms  of 
showing liver involvement. In this study, ALP levels were 
not  significantly  different  between  the  healthy  control 
group and the sarcoidosis patients, although ALP levels 
were found to be associated with galectin-3 levels in the 
sarcoidosis  patients.  Galectin-3  levels  increase  in  the 
presence of acute and chronic inflammation. Like galec-
tin-3, ALP is a biomarker that is used as a marker of in-
flammation  [24].  The  relationship  between  galectin-3 
and ALP levels can be explained by the fact that the levels 
of both markers increase in the presence of inflammation.
Platelet distribution width (PDW) is associated with 
thrombocyte activation and has been shown to play a role 
in thrombosis, and to be elevated in the presence of bone 
marrow involvement and inflammation [25, 26]. In the 
present study, PDW was significantly higher in the sar-
coidosis patients when compared to the healthy controls. 
Moreover, a negative relationship was identified between 
PDW and galectin-3 levels in sarcoidosis patients, where-
as a positive association was found between these 2 pa-
rameters in the control group. In the light of these data, it 
may be argued that pulmonary fibrosis may develop in 
sarcoidosis patients with low PDW values, although fur-
ther studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.

We aimed to use galectin-3 in the prognosis or staging 
of sarcoidosis but not in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis fibro-
sis and fibrotic process is seen in advanced stages of sar-
coidosis and fibrosis is not a specific condition of the dis-
ease.  Our  findings  demonstrating  that  galectin-3  levels 

were significantly elevated in sarcoidosis patients at stage 
2 or higher with parenchymal involvement suggest that se-
rum galectin-3 can be used to assess the staging and sever-
ity of sarcoidosis. While several parameters have been in-
vestigated for the assessment of response to treatment and 
progression of sarcoidosis, there is currently no universal-
ly accepted and routinely used parameter for either of these 
purposes. Despite being a benign disease in general, sar-
coidosis is still is a matter of concern due to the challenges 
faced in its diagnosis, its economic burden on health ex-
penditure, and its consequences in terms of loss of work-
force. We suggest that serum galectin-3 could be a useful 
parameter in sarcoidosis for several reasons, including its 
ease of use, its amenability for rapid testing and its ability 
to identify fibrosis earlier than radiology, and the conse-
quent avoidance of radiation exposure. That said, there are 
several limitations to our study, including the low number 
of patients at stage 3 and 4. Furthermore, this study was not 
designed as a controlled progressive study for the monitor-
ing of patients with diseases progressing with pulmonary 
fibrosis.  In  addition,  only  a  snapshot  of  galectin-3  levels 
was obtained in the study, and therefore, serum galectin-3 
levels during the course of disease were not compared in 
sarcoidosis patients taking into account progression status. 
Accordingly, there is a need for prospective studies involv-
ing larger patient groups to investigate the routine use of 
serum galectin-3 in sarcoidosis patients and clarify its re-
lationship with other parameters affecting disease course.

Conclusion

There are currently no parameters that can be used as 
a marker of progression and disease activity in sarcoid-
osis. In the present study, we found that serum levels of 
galectin-3  were  significantly  elevated  in  sarcoidosis  pa-
tients when compared to healthy controls and that levels 
were  significantly  increased  particularly  in  patients  at 
stage 2 or higher, associated with parenchymal involve-
ment. Serum galectin-3 levels may be used in the moni-
toring of sarcoidosis, being a simple and rapid approach 
that avoids radiation exposure and reveals pulmonary fi-
brosis prior to radiological staging.
