Abstract

The automatic transformation of verbose, nat-
ural language descriptions into structured pro-
cess models remains a challenge of significant
complexity - This paper introduces a contem-
porary solution, where central to our approach,
is the use of dependency parsing and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting key
elements from textual descriptions. Addition-
ally, we utilize Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) con-
structs for identifying action relationships and
integrate semantic analysis tools, including
WordNet, for enriched contextual understand-
ing. A novel aspect of our system is the ap-
plication of neural coreference resolution, inte-
grated with the SpaCy framework, enhancing
the precision of entity linkage and anaphoric
references. Furthermore, the system adeptly
handles data transformation and visualization,
converting extracted information into BPMN
(Business Process Model and Notation) dia-
grams. This methodology not only streamlines
the process of capturing and representing busi-
ness workflows but also significantly reduces
the manual effort and potential for error inher-
ent in traditional modeling approaches.

Introduction

In the dynamic domain of business process
management (BPM), the task of translating de-
tailed process descriptions from their natural,
often verbose, linguistic form into structured,
formal models stands as a critical yet arduous
endeavor. This task, which has traditionally
been dependent on manual interpretation and
modeling by experts, is riddled with inherent
challenges. Among these, the most prominent
are the significant consumption of time and
resources, the introduction of subjectivity and
human bias from the varying resources carry-
ing out a singular process, and the consequent
high propensity for errors. Such challenges

are compounded when dealing with complex,
multifaceted business processes that are often
described in a language rich with nuances and
implicit meanings.

The emergence and continual advancement
of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tech-
nologies herald a transformative shift in this
landscape. Their application in the field of
BPM is particularly significant, as it holds
the promise of solving the varying challenges
of converting unstructured text into structured
process models, and with our efforts, we in-
tend to create a holistic solution for automation.
This automation is more than a mere transla-
tion of words; it involves an understanding of
linguistic constructs, the identification and ex-
traction of key process elements such as tasks,
participants, decision points, and the contex-
tual interpretation of these elements to ensure
coherence in the resulting models.

Moreover, the ability of NLP to process and
analyze language at scale can address the ineffi-
ciencies associated with manual modeling. By
leveraging techniques such as semantic analy-
sis, syntactic parsing, entity recognition, and
co-reference resolution, NLP can sift through
complex process narratives, distill essential in-
formation, and represent it in a standardized
format like BPMN (Business Process Model
and Notation). This capability not only en-
hances the accuracy and consistency of process
models but also significantly expedites the pro-
cess modeling exercise, thereby enabling or-
ganizations to rapidly document, analyze, and
optimize their business processes.

In essence, the integration of NLP into BPM
represents a confluence of linguistic intelli-
gence and process management acumen, of-

 
 
 
 
 
 
fering a pathway to more efficient, accurate,
and scalable business process documentation.
This intersection has the potential to fundamen-
tally alter how organizations approach process
modeling and optimization, marking a pivotal
advancement in the field of business process
management.

2 Problem Statement

To succinctly restate, at the heart of this re-
search lies the ambitious endeavor of automat-
ing the transformation of unstructured, natural
language descriptions of business processes
into structured BPMN diagrams. This transfor-
mation is not merely a linear translation but a
complex re-engineering of text into a formal,
diagrammatic representation that captures the
intricacies and nuances of business processes.
Despite the remarkable advancements in NLP,
the application of these technologies in the
realm of business process modeling poses dis-
tinct and multifaceted challenges.

A primary challenge is the accurate identi-
fication and categorization of various entities
and actions embedded in the text. Business
process descriptions in natural language are
typically riddled with specialized terminology,
implicit assumptions, and complex constructs
that vary significantly across different organi-
zations and industries. Extracting meaningful
and relevant information from such varied and
intricate narratives demands an NLP system
that goes beyond basic text parsing to under-
stand the context and underlying semantics.

Moreover, understanding the relationships
between extracted entities is critical. In busi-
ness process narratives, entities do not exist in
isolation; their interactions and interdependen-
cies form the backbone of the process. The
NLP system must, therefore, be capable of
discerning these relationships, often implied
or intricately expressed, and accurately reflect
them in the BPMN diagrams.

Related challenges, as a result of the nu-
ances of the English language, revolve around
concepts like, ’Alias Detection’, where diverse
linguistic expressions often obscurely refer-
ence the same participant or entity. This issue

necessitates an in-depth linguistic analysis to
accurately identify participants amid numer-
ous potential aliases. The second challenge
pertains to the idea of ’Anaphora Resolution’,
which involves clarifying pronouns and other
references in the text to mitigate interpreta-
tional ambiguity and ensure precision in the
subsequent process mapping.

Another significant challenge is the effective
mapping of identified entities and relationships
into a standardized business process frame-
work. BPMN, being a globally recognized
and widely used standard, has specific nota-
tions and conventions that must be adhered to.
The translation from text to BPMN involves
not only placing entities and actions into ap-
propriate BPMN constructs but also ensuring
that the flow and logic of the process are pre-
served. An envisioned solution would follow
a pipeline similar to Figure 1.

Figure 1: Proposed solution for task and relationship
extraction from natural language

Lastly, and perhaps most critically, is the
challenge of maintaining the semantic integrity
of the original text during this transformation.
The effectiveness of a BPMN diagram hinges
on its fidelity to the original process descrip-
tion. Any loss of meaning or context in the
translation can lead to inaccuracies in the dia-
gram, potentially resulting in misinterpretation
and misapplication of the process. Thus, the
NLP system must be sensitive to the subtleties
of language and context, ensuring that the
BPMN diagrams it produces are not only struc-
turally accurate but also semantically faithful
to the source text.

3 Objectives and NLP Techniques in

solving BPM Problems

The overarching objective of this research ini-
tiative is to pioneer the development of a sys-
tem with solution-oriented NLP techniques,
each playing a pivotal role in the system’s func-
tionality.

Foremost among these techniques is depen-
dency parsing, a critical tool for deciphering
the syntactic structure of sentences. By dis-
cerning how words in a sentence relate to one
another, dependency parsing enables the sys-
tem to extract the core components of business
processes, such as tasks, participants, and tem-
poral sequences, with remarkable precision.

Complementing this is the use of Named
Entity Recognition (NER), an NLP technique
adept at identifying and classifying key terms
within text. In the context of BPM, NER is
invaluable for pinpointing specific business en-
tities, actions, and resources, thereby laying
the groundwork for their accurate representa-
tion in BPMN diagrams.

Another cornerstone of this system is neural
coreference resolution. This advanced tech-
nique addresses the challenge of understand-
ing pronouns and other referring expressions
within the text, linking them back to the ap-
propriate entities. The integration of neural
coreference resolution ensures that the system
can maintain narrative coherence across a busi-
ness process description, a crucial factor for
the accurate mapping of processes, addressing
our earlier concerns of aliases and anaphoras
within text.

Additionally, the system leverages the se-
mantic analysis capabilities of tools like Word-
Net. By providing a rich semantic network
of English words, WordNet allows the system
to delve beyond surface-level text interpreta-
tion, enabling it to grasp the nuanced meanings
and relationships inherent in business process
descriptions.

4 Review of Existing Approaches in the

Literature

The recent advancements in the intersection of
NLP and BPM have led to innovative method-

ologies for transforming textual descriptions
into structured BPMN models. This integra-
tion is crucial for automating and streamlining
the process of BPMN generation, as illustrated
by the breadth of research in this domain.

Chen et al. (2021) explored event-centric
NLP, laying the groundwork for understanding
complex event structures in text, which is es-
sential for accurate BPMN model extraction.
Their work aligns with Guimin et al. (2021),
who delved into relation extraction with type-
aware map memories, emphasizing the impor-
tance of understanding word dependencies in
NLP for BPMN.

Loper and Bird’s (2002) introduction of the
NLTK toolkit offered foundational NLP tools
and methodologies, facilitating the analysis
and processing of natural language, a key step
in BPMN model generation. Sinha and Parad-
kar (2010) utilized use cases to convert pro-
cess specifications into BPMN, demonstrating
a practical application of NLP in BPM.

Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) addressed
the challenge of pronominal anaphora reso-
lution, a critical aspect in understanding and
maintaining the coherence of textual descrip-
tions for BPMN conversion. On the other hand,
Epure et al. (2015) contributed by automating
process model discovery from textual method-
ologies, showcasing the potential of NLP in
extracting meaningful process information.

Honkisz, Kluza, and Wi´sniewski (2018) pro-
posed a novel concept for generating BPMN
models from natural language, emphasizing
the need for effective syntactic analysis in NLP
for BPMN generation. Similarly, Van der Aa et
al. (2019, 2020) focused on extracting declar-
ative process models from natural language
and further advanced the field by integrating
speech recognition, enhancing the accessibil-
ity and intuitiveness of BPMN model gener-
ation. We also see this in the research of De
Marneffe and Manning (2008) contributed to
the syntactic parsing techniques essential for
understanding natural language, a key step in
BPMN model generation. Santoro, Borges,
and Pino (2008) and Ghose, Koliadis, and
Chueng (2007) explored narrative structures

and process discovery from textual artifacts,
enriching the methodologies for BPMN model
generation from diverse text sources.

In conclusion, these studies collectively rep-
resent a significant leap forward in BPMN
model generation from text. By addressing
the complexities of natural language and lever-
aging various NLP techniques, these research
efforts have not only streamlined the process
of BPMN generation but also enhanced the ac-
curacy and efficiency of these models, thereby
making significant contributions to the field of
business process management.

5 Methodology

Our multifaceted approach is not simply about
deploying NLP algorithms in isolation but
rather about orchestrating a series of intercon-
nected and sophisticated steps, each critically
contributing to the ultimate goal of automating
and refining business process modeling.

To begin,

the constants module in this
project serves as an essential cornerstone for
the NLP-based processing, encapsulating a so-
phisticated understanding of language struc-
ture crucial for analyzing business process
descriptions. It meticulously defines a com-
prehensive set of enumerations, each pivotal
for different aspects of syntactic and semantic
analysis within the NLP framework. For in-
stance, the Descriptor class outlines key gram-
matical roles and dependencies fundamental
to dependency parsing, a vital NLP technique
that deciphers the syntactic hierarchy and re-
lationships between words in a sentence. This
parsing is crucial for extracting meaningful in-
formation like tasks, participants, and actions
from complex textual descriptions. Similarly,
the VerbType and KeywordType classes cate-
gorize verbs and keywords that are instrumen-
tal in identifying specific actions and decision
points in business processes, such as message
events and conditional flows. These catego-
rizations are critical in parsing business logic
from natural language, enabling the system
to distinguish and prioritize elements that are
essential for BPMN modeling.

A crucial aspect of the methodology in-

volves Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) extraction,
which enhances the approach introduced by
Krzysztof et al. (2018). Hopping off of their
approach of identifying key components from
the text, i.e. ’Activity’, ’Condition’, ’Who’,
and ’Terminated’ as seen in Table 1 - we en-
hance this approach by delving deeper into the
different roles and enhancing contextual un-
derstanding of those roles through WordNet
within our system - we also introduced indus-
try specific roles as part of a larger project
to inculcate newer roles not found in the ear-
lier addressed framekwork. Additionally, we
swapped the static condition extraction, the
participant extraction methodology, and the
general model creation through bpmn-python
for more efficient and accurate alternatives,
and the inclusion of swimlanes, not previously
found in explored literature.

These method employs advanced syntactic
analysis techniques to identify SVO constructs
within the text. The SVO extraction method is
based on the concept that tasks performed by
an entity can be effectively summarized in a
Subject-Verb-Object format, comprising three
key components:

1. Subject: Represents the entity or actor

initiating the action or task.

2. Verb: Signifies the action or operation

being performed.

3. Object: Denotes the entity or object upon
which the action is executed or the target
of the task.

SVO constructs are essential for represent-
ing the tasks and activities within business pro-
cesses. They play a fundamental role in un-
derstanding the dynamics and interactions de-
picted in process narratives. By systematically
extracting and analyzing SVO constructs, the
methodology provides a structured approach
to dissecting business process descriptions, fa-
cilitating more effective modeling, analysis,
and optimization. This approach enhances the
understanding of how various entities interact
within the business context, ultimately improv-

More critically, the participant extractor
module plays a critical role in meticulously
identifying and extracting participant informa-
tion from business process descriptions. This
module employs targeted NLP techniques to
recognize and categorize various entities, in-
cluding users, systems, or roles mentioned in
the text. Accurate categorization within the
context of the business process is essential for
constructing comprehensive process models
that reflect all stakeholders accurately. How-
ever, in the process of identifying participants,
the presence of pronouns or aliases referring
to entities can hinder accurate identification of
SVO constructs. To address this challenge,
the neural coreference resolution technique
was integrated into the system. The neural
coreference resolution process involves iden-
tifying and replacing all aliases and pronouns
that refer to a specific entity within the natu-
ral language text with the neuralcoref library.
This ensures that the text is consistently repre-
sented in terms of the identified entities. Sub-
sequently, this information serves as the basis
for deriving roles and responsibilities within
the business process, and aided in the creation
of lanes within the pool of the BPMN diagram,
contributing to the overall effectiveness of the
participant extraction module.

The conversion module in conjunction with
this handles the challenge posed by the het-
erogeneity and variability of data formats and
structures inherent in natural language sources.
It meticulously standardizes and prepares the
textual data from these diverse formats, ensur-
ing that it is in a suitable and uniform structure

for detailed and intricate NLP analysis. This
pre-processing step is pivotal; By standardiz-
ing the format and structure of the input text,
this module ensures that the text is optimally
primed for accurate interpretation and in-depth
analysis by the subsequent NLP algorithms.
We address the complex challenge of represent-
ing the fluid and often ambiguous constructs
of human language in a structured, machine-
processable format by creating clearly defined
data models and structures for entities such as
processes, tasks, or actors, this module trans-
lates the intricacies and subtleties of human
language into a structured, organized format
that can be effectively processed and analyzed
by machines.

In our concluding note, we created a mod-
ule to manually create the xml for the model
generation as no current tools create a holistic
BPMN with discernible roles, and while pe-
ripheral to the core NLP techniques, is vital
in the context of data integration and handling.
It focuses on the graphical representation of
the processed data, including the creation of
BPMN diagrams and other forms of visualiza-
tions. This module is critical for translating
the structured process data, which has been
meticulously analyzed and modeled through
the application of various NLP techniques, into
visual formats that are easily understandable
and accessible to users. The ability to present
complex process models and data in a visually
intelligible and appealing format is essential
for the practical application and usability of
the insights gained from the NLP analysis. It
enables users, who may not be experts in NLP
or BPMN, to understand, interpret, and utilize
the results of the process modeling exercise

effectively.

In conclusion, the methodology adopted in
this project exemplifies a deep and sophisti-
cated understanding of both NLP and its prac-
tical applications in the realm of business pro-
cess management. From the initial preparation
and standardization of data to the intricate lin-
guistic analysis, entity extraction, and the final
visual representation, each step in the method-
ology is carefully designed and executed to
contribute to the seamless translation of natu-
ral language into structured, actionable busi-
ness process models. This approach not only
demonstrates technical proficiency and innova-
tion but also reflects a keen awareness of the
practical needs and challenges in the field of
business process management.

6 Results

The application of the proposed methodol-
ogy in this project successfully automated sev-
eral critical aspects of transforming natural
language process descriptions into structured
BPMN diagrams. The results were notable in
the areas of participant extraction, relationship
extraction, alias detection, anaphora resolution,
and condition/decision extraction, as a holistic
solution. Each of these components played a
pivotal role in accurately and efficiently mod-
eling business processes. The creation of the
model is seen in Figure 2.

The results of this project demonstrate the
substantial potential of NLP techniques in au-
tomating and enhancing the process of busi-

ness process modeling. The identification
of tasks, participants, relationships, and de-
cision points, coupled with effective alias and
anaphora resolution, underscores the system’s
capability to transform natural language de-
scriptions into comprehensive and accurate
BPMN diagrams. These findings make a sig-
nificant contribution to the field of BPM, par-
ticularly by introducing a role-based perspec-
tive in BPMN modeling. This novel approach,
absent in previous literature, holds great signif-
icance within a business context as it facilitates
a comprehensive understanding of how tasks
align with the resources responsible for their
execution, fostering improved cooperation and
resource utilization.

7 Discussion

7.1

Interpretation of Results

The results obtained from this project provide
a compelling insight into the efficacy of NLP
techniques in the domain of business process
modeling. The successful implementation of
task identification, participant extraction, rela-
tionship extraction, alias detection, anaphora
resolution, and condition/decision extraction
signifies a major stride in addressing the core
research question: How can NLP techniques
be effectively utilized to transform unstruc-
tured natural language descriptions into struc-
tured BPMN diagrams?

The identification of tasks and participants,
and the extraction of their interrelationships,
directly contribute to creating comprehensive
BPMN models that accurately mirror real-
world business processes. This is a significant
advancement, considering the complexity and
nuances involved in interpreting unstructured
text. The ability to detect aliases and resolve
anaphoras further enhances the coherence and
consistency of the BPMN diagrams, ensuring
that they are not only accurate but also under-
standable and usable for business analysts.

Moreover, the extraction of conditions and
decision points from the process descriptions
is particularly noteworthy. This aspect of the
system goes beyond mere structural modeling,
delving into the logical and decision-making

strates the system’s capability to handle not
just the ’what’ and ’who’ of processes but also
the ’how’ and ’why,’ which are often more
challenging to model.

7.2 Comparison with Existing Literature

When compared with existing literature and
methodologies in the field, the results of this
project exhibit several distinct advantages. Tra-
ditional approaches to BPMN modeling often
rely heavily on manual interpretation and con-
version of process descriptions, which can be
time-consuming and prone to errors. In con-
trast, the automated approach developed in this
project significantly reduces the time and ef-
fort required for process modeling, while also
improving accuracy and consistency.

Previous studies and tools in the domain,
such as those discussed in the literature review,
have demonstrated various degrees of success
in automating parts of the business process
modeling task. However, many of these ap-
proaches have limitations, particularly in han-
dling complex linguistic structures, detecting
nuanced relationships, and maintaining coher-
ence in the models, and perhaps, more criti-
cally - poor identification of participants in lieu
of creating lanes within the subsequent BPMN
model. The comprehensive approach of this
project, which integrates multiple advanced
NLP techniques, addresses these limitations ef-
fectively. It not only automates the extraction
of basic process elements but also successfully
interprets and models complex linguistic and
logical constructs present in natural language
descriptions.

8 Limitations

While the project demonstrates significant ad-
vancements in employing Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques for business pro-
cess modeling, it is important to acknowledge
certain limitations inherent in the approach.

8.1 Dependence on Language Quality

The system’s accuracy and effectiveness heav-
ily depend on the quality of the natural lan-

guage input. In cases where process descrip-
tions are poorly structured, ambiguous, or con-
tain a high degree of colloquial language, the
system may face challenges in accurately ex-
tracting process elements. This limitation high-
lights the need for well-articulated and clearly
structured input, which may not always be fea-
sible in real-world business scenarios.

8.2 Handling of Complex and Nested

Structures

While the system performs well with standard
and moderately complex process descriptions,
it may struggle with highly complex or deeply
nested linguistic structures. Processes involv-
ing multiple layers of decision-making or intri-
cate participant interactions may not be fully
captured by the current NLP techniques im-
plemented. This limitation points to the need
for further development and refinement of the
algorithms to handle such complexities more
effectively.

8.3 Limitations of the SVO approach

In the context of task identification, while SVO
constructs provide a structured framework for
representing actions within business processes,
it is important to acknowledge that SVO alone
may not always be the best approach. Tasks
within complex business processes can exhibit
intricate dependencies and nuanced interac-
tions that may not be fully encapsulated by a
simplistic SVO format. SVO constructs tend to
oversimplify the statement creating unnatural
In sce-
representations of the task at hand.
narios where tasks involve conditional actions,
parallel processing, or intricate decision trees,
relying solely on SVO constructs may lead to
an incomplete and inaccurate representation
of the actual process dynamics. Therefore,
a more comprehensive approach will produce
more natural and accurate tasks for the BPMN.

8.4 Generalizability Across Languages

The current implementation primarily focuses
on English language process descriptions. The
system’s applicability and effectiveness in
other languages have not been fully explored.

This limitation is significant in a global context
where business processes often span multiple
languages and cultural contexts.

9 Conclusion

This project represents a significant advance-
ment in the application of NLP techniques for
transforming natural language process descrip-
tions into structured BPMN diagrams. The
methodology developed and the results ob-
tained underscore the potential of NLP in au-
tomating and refining business process mod-
eling, a task traditionally characterized by its
manual intensity and complexity.

The system’s ability to accurately identify
tasks, extract participants, delineate relation-
ships, detect aliases, resolve anaphora, and ex-
tract conditions and decision points from natu-
ral language text is a testament to the power of
NLP. It not only enhances the efficiency and
accuracy of BPMN modeling but also offers a
deeper, more coherent interpretation of process
descriptions than many existing methods.

However, as acknowledged in the limita-
tions section, the system does have constraints,
including its dependence on the quality of the
input language, contextual understanding, scal-
ability, and language generalizability. These
limitations offer valuable insights and direc-
tions for future research. Addressing these
challenges could lead to even more sophisti-
cated NLP systems capable of handling a wider
variety of business process modeling scenarios,
including those involving real-time processing,
complex decision-making structures, and mul-
tilingual environments.

In conclusion, this project paves the way
for further advancements in the field of BPM,
opening new avenues for research and devel-
opment. The integration of advanced NLP
techniques in business process modeling has
the potential to significantly transform how or-
ganizations document, analyze, and optimize
their processes. As NLP technology continues
to evolve, its integration into BPM tools is ex-
pected to become more refined, making these
tools even more powerful and essential in the
world of business process management.
