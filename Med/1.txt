Abstract 
Background:  Sleep disorders are one of the most common and annoying problems among patients with heart 
failure, which decrease their quality of life. Participation in physical activity is one of the most effective methods to 
reduce sleep disorders; however, few patients participate. This study was conducted to examine the relationship 
between physical activities and sleep quality among heart failure patients.

Methods:  A convenience sample of 100 patients with heart failure referred to rehabilitation centers in southeastern 
Iran was used in this descriptive cross-sectional study. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Rapid Assessment 
of Physical Activity (RAPA) were used to collect data. The Spearman correlation coefficient and regression were used 
to analyze the data. The significance level was < 0.05.

 2.83, with the majority of them (84.47%) 
Results:  The results revealed that the mean score of sleep quality was 8.74 
having poor sleep quality. The mean score of physical activity was 2.59 
 1.33, and the majority of them (95.15%) had 
sub-optimal physical activity. There was a significant and inverse relationship between the total scores of sleep quality 
and physical activity, and patients’ sleep quality improved while physical activity increased. Physical activity, sex, his-
tory of heart surgery, and the stage of illness were found to account for 31% of the variances in patients’ sleep quality.

Conclusion:  The results of this study showed better sleep quality among patients who were more physically active. 
Given that the majority of patients with heart failure suffer from sleep disorders, patients’ knowledge of physical activ-
ity should be increased to improve their quality of sleep and quality of life.

Introduction
In most countries around the world, heart failure is one 
of the leading causes of disability [1]. It is estimated that 
by  2030,  the  global  rate  of  heart  disease  mortality  will 
have risen to more than 23.3 million people [2]. Patients 
with heart failure who have a decreased functional capa-
bility,  dyspnea,  and  disability  face  numerous  problems, 
including sleep disorders [3].

Sleep  disorder  is  one  of  the  most  common  problems 
among patients with heart failure, and their sleep quality 
is  considered  a  basic  care  requirement  [4].  Deprivation 
of  good  sleep  increases  the  secretion  of  catecholamine, 
blood  pressure,  the  amount  of  oxygen  needed  by  the 
heart, and ultimately increases the burden on the heart; 
therefore, it leads to many physical and mental problems 
as well as a decrease in the quality of life [5]. It seems that 
lifestyle  can  affect  the  symptoms  of  heart  failure  such 
as  sleep  disorders  [6].  However,  limitations  in  lifestyle, 
social isolation and mood disorders make these patients 
unable to enjoy adequate and quality sleep [7].

Today, physical activity is one of the simplest and pos-
sibly the most inexpensive strategies for improving the 
lifestyle of cardiovascular patients [8]. Physical activity 
is any physical movement that requires energy expendi-
ture  and  is  generated  by  skeletal  muscle  [9].  Physi-
cal  activity  can  moderate  risk  factors  in  heart  failure 
patients  [10].  Patients  can  do  more  activities  without 
becoming  tired  or  short  of  breath,  and  improves  their 
quality  of  life  because  physical  activity  improves  mus-
cle tone, strengthens the heart muscle and cardiovascu-
lar system, which improves the heart’s ability to pump, 
improves  circulation  and  helps  the  body  use  oxygen 
better  and  increase  energy  levels  [11].  Regular  physi-
cal activity can also help sleep better, as it can increase 
sleep  duration,  improve  sleep  quality,  and  reduce  the 
onset  of  sleep  or  the  time  it  takes  to  fall  asleep  [12]. 
However,  most  heart  failure  patients  do  not  engage  in 
long-term and regular physical activity [13].

According  to  reports,  heart  failure  patients’  physical 
activity  is  on  average  16%  lower  than  that  of  healthy 
people [14]. It seems that lack of knowledge about self-
care  and  inadequate  care  at  home  makes  heart  failure 
patients unaware of the importance of physical activity 
[15]. Even patients with heart failure believe they must 
rest and do not engage in physical activity after admis-
sion to hospital [16]. Therefore, it is important to study 
the  relationship  between  physical  activities  and  sleep 
quality  and  their  effects  on  the  quality  of  life  of  heart 
failure patients.

The prevalence of heart failure in Iran is posing a seri-
ous challenge to the Iranian health system [17]. Between 
29 and 47% of patients are readmitted within 3–6 months 
of  their  initial  discharge,  while  50%  of  readmissions  are 
avoidable  [18].  On  the  other  hand,  insufficient  physi-
cal  activity  is  a  concern  in  Iranian  society,  particularly 
among  Iranian  adults  [19].  Thirty  to  seventy  percent  of 
Iranian patients with cardiac diseases, like the rest of the 
population,  do  not  engage  in  enough  physical  activity 
[20].  Another  issue  is  that  56%  of  Iranian  patients  with 
heart failure suffer from sleep disorders and have to take 
sleeping  pills  [21].  A  review  of  the  literature  shows  that 
physical activity, regardless of its mode and intensity, has 
increased sleep efficiency, especially in patients on hemo-
dialysis,  with  diabetes,  sleep  apnea,  obesity,  cancer,  and 
rheumatoid arthritis [22–27].

In  view  of  the  above,  it  seems  that  physical  activity 
among  patients  with  heart  failure  has  been  neglected 
and the problems of patients with heart failure especially 
sleep  disorder  and  its  related  factors  should  be  given 
more  attention.  In  addition,  physical  activity  and  sleep 
habits  can  be  influenced  by  the  culture  and  customs  of 
societies, which have not been studied in Iran; therefore, 
this  study  was  performed  to  investigate  the  relationship 

between  sleep  quality  and  physical  activity  among 
patients with heart failure.

Method
Study design and setting

The  current  research  was  a  cross-sectional  descriptive 
correlational study on patients with heart failure referred 
to cardiac rehabilitation centers affiliated to Jahrom Uni-
versity of Medical Sciences in southeast Iran with a code 
of  ethics  (IR.KMU.REC.1399.269)  from  Kerman  Uni-
versity  of  Medical  Sciences  and  guideline  for  reporting 
observational  studies  (STROBE).  This  study  lasted  from 
October to January 2020.

Sample and sampling
Considering  correlation  coefficient  (− 0.391),  95%  con-
fidence and 90% test power, 61 samples were calculated, 
but with an effect size of 1.5, 110 eligible patients admit-
ted to cardiac rehabilitation centers were recruited by the 
convenience  sampling  method  to  minimize  the  risk  of 
dropout and 103 patients completed the study. The inclu-
sion  criteria  included  patients  with  stages  2–3  of  heart 
failure diagnosed by a cardiologist [28], patients over the 
age  of  18  who  were  physically  and  mentally  capable  of 
answering the questionnaire items, and patients in a sta-
ble state of the disease. The patients who did not answer 
to one-third of the questionnaire items and had instable 
state of the disease were excluded from the study.

Data collection tools

Data  were  collected  using  a  demographic  information 
questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 
and the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA).

Demographic information questionnaire

patient’s  age,  sex,  marital  status,  occupation,  monthly 
income,  level  of  education,  stage  of  disease,  period  of 
illness,  other  diseases,  medications,  weight,  addiction, 
history  of  heart  surgery,  other  chronic  illness,  and  the 
number of admissions in the previous 6 months or year 
were all included in the questionnaire.

Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)

This  questionnaire  is  used  to  assess  the  quality  of  sleep 
and  contains  19  items  rated  on  a  4-point  Likert  scale 
from  0  to  3.  The  questionnaire  has  seven  subscales  of 
subjective  sleep  quality,  sleep  latency,  sleep  duration, 
habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep-
ing medications and daytime dysfunction. The question-
naire total score ranges from 0 to 21 with a score of more 
than  five  indicating  poor  sleep  quality.  The  participant’s 
score  in  each  item  would  range  from  0  to  three,  indi-
cating  no  problem  at  all,  moderate  problems,  serious

problems and very serious problems, respectively. Using 
Cronbach’s  alpha,  Buysse  et  al.  (1989),  who  developed 
and  introduced  this  questionnaire,  obtained  an  internal 
consistency of 0.83. According to their findings, this scale 
has  a  sensitivity  of  89.6%  and  a  specificity  of  86.5%  in 
the diagnosis of poor sleep (score > 5). Poor sleep quality 
was diagnosed with a combination of clinical interviews, 
structured  interviews,  and  polysomnographic  data  and 
compared with the standard score above five [29, 30]. In 
Iran, the validity of this questionnaire was confirmed by 
content validity. Split-half reliability was used to measure 
the  consistency  of  the  scores  of  this  questionnaire  and 
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.79 [31].

Rapid assessment of physical activity (RAPA) questionnaire

RAPA  assesses  the  amount  and  intensity  of  physical 
activity  and  consists  of  nine  items  with  the  response 
options  of  yes  or  no.  The  first  section  of  the  question-
naire  defines  light,  moderate,  and  vigorous  activities  for 
the  participants,  and  the  second  section  includes  items 
about  their  activities  during  the  week.  The  RAPA  ques-
tionnaire consists of seven items that assess the amount, 
intensity, and duration of physical activity, as well as two 
items  that  assess  flexibility,  strength  and  the  total  score 
of  physical  activity.  The  lowest  possible  score  was  zero, 
and  the  highest  possible  score  was  nine.  A  score  of  less 
than  six  indicates  sub-optimal  physical  activity,  while  a 
score of more than six indicates optimal physical activity. 
To score, choose the question with the highest score with 
an  affirmative  response.  Any  score  less  than  six  is  sub-
optimal. Topolski et al. (2006) used the Spearman’s rank 
correlation  coefficients  to  validate  the  physical  activity 
questionnaire  and  investigate  the  relationship  between 
physical  activity  and  energy  expenditure.  They  reported 
RAPA  questionnaire  with  high  sensitivity  (81%),  speci-
ficity  (69%),  and  negative  predictive  value  (77%)  [28].  In 
Iran, this instrument was used by Khajavi and Khanmo-
hamadi  (2015).  The  validity  of  the  tool  was  confirmed 
by  a  confirmatory  factor  analysis.  The  reliability  of  the 
instrument  was  obtained  with  Cronbach’s  alpha  coeffi-
cient (0.87) [32].

Data analysis

Data  were  analyzed  using  SPSS25.  The  demographic 
and  background  characteristics  of  research  units,  as 
well as the mean physical activity and sleep quality were 
described using descriptive statistics (frequency, percent-
age, mean and standard deviation). The normality of the 
data  distribution  was  assessed  using  the  Kolmogorov–
Smirnov  test.  Physical  activity  score  did  not  follow  the 
normal  distribution,  but  distribution  of  quality  of  sleep 
score was normal; therefore, Spearman correlation coef-
ficient  was  used  to  examine  the  relationship  between 

the overall score of sleep quality and its dimensions and 
physical  activity.  Multiple  linear  regression  was  used 
to  determine  predictors  of  sleep  quality  and  analyze 
the  relationship  between  a  dependent  variable  (score  of 
sleep  quality)  and  several  independent  variables.  Physi-
cal  activity  and  background  variables  were  entered  into 
regression by backward method and the final model was 
given  in  the  table. The  significance  level  was  considered 
P < 0.05.

Results
The  samples  had  a  mean  age  of  55.98 ± 11.38  years. 
The  mean  disease  duration  among  the  samples  was 
7.23 ± 5.03  years.  Table  1  lists  the  remaining  demo-
graphic characteristics of the patients.

According  to  the  results,  the  mean  sleep  quality  of 
the  samples  was  8.74 ± 2.83.  The  majority  of  patients 
(84.47%)  had  poor  sleep  quality,  and  among  the  dimen-
sions  of  sleep  quality,  habitual  sleep  efficiency  was  the 
best  and  sleep  duration  and  sleep  disturbances  were 
the  worst.  Sleep  latency  (24.27%)  was  serious  in  nearly 
a  quarter  of  patients,  and  it  was  very  serious  in  23.30% 
of them. The majority of them (48.54%) had no problem 
with habitual sleep efficiency. 63.11% of them had serious 
sleep disorders and 43.69% of them had no daytime dys-
function.  Subjective  sleep  quality  was  relatively  good  in 
49.5% of the patients. However, 38.8% of them had rela-
tively poor subjective sleep quality. 49.51% of the patients 
slept for 6–7 h, while 37.86% slept for 5–6 h. 44.66% had 
used sleeping medications at least once a week (Table 2). 
The  results  showed  that  the  mean  physical  activity  in 
patients  was  2.59 ± 1.33  and  the  majority  of  patients 
(95.15%) had sub-optimal physical activity (Table 3).

According to the results, the total score of sleep qual-
ity had a significant and inverse relationship with physi-
cal  activity,  meaning  that  increasing  physical  activity 
improved  the  sleep  quality  of  heart  failure  patients.  A 
higher  sleep  quality  score  indicates  poor  sleep  quality, 
while a higher physical activity score indicates optimum 
physical activity due to the inverse sleep score (Table 4). 
Among  the  subscales  of  sleep  quality,  subjective  sleep 
quality,  habitual  sleep  efficiency,  sleep  disturbances,  use 
of  sleeping  medications  and  daytime  dysfunction  had  a 
significant and inverse relationship with physical activity. 
These results revealed that as physical activity increased, 
sleep  quality  improved  among  the  subscales  described 
(Table 5).

Based  on  demographic  and  background  variables, 
multiple  linear  regression  with  backward  method  was 
used  to  predict  patients’  sleep  quality.  The  patients’ 
sleep  quality  was  considered  as  a  dependent  vari-
able.  Physical  activity,  age,  BMI,  period  of  illness,  sex, 
marital  status,  income,  substance  use,  history  of  heart

surgery,  stage  of  illness,  and  number  of  admissions 
were  all  independent  variables.  Following  the  selec-
tion of the best model, the results revealed that physical 
activity,  sex,  history  of  heart  surgery,  and  stage  of  dis-
ease were predictors of patients’ sleep quality, account-
ing for 31% of the variances in sleep quality. According 

to  beta  coefficients,  physical  activity  and  sex  had  an 
indirect  effect.  Patients’  sleep  quality  has  improved  in 
female  sex  and  as  a  result  of  increased  physical  activ-
ity. History of heart surgery and stage of disease had a 
direct  impact.  Patients’  sleep  quality  has  deteriorated 
due to a history of heart surgery and increased stage of 
illness (Table 6).

Discussion
This  study  aimed  to  examine  the  relationship  between 
sleep  quality  and  physical  activity  among  heart  failure 
patients referred to rehabilitation centers in southeastern 
Iran.

The  results  showed  that  the  majority  of  patients  had 
poor  sleep  quality.  A  significant  proportion  of  patients 
had serious and very serious problems in the subscales of 
sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, 
and daytime dysfunction. A large number of patients had 
poor subjective sleep quality and inadequate sleep dura-
tion,  and  about  half  of  the  patients  took  sleeping  medi-
cations. Consistent with the results of the current study, 
Hajj  et  al.  (2020)  in  the  United  States,  Azevedo  et  al. 
(2015)  in  Brazil,  Jorge-Samitier  et  al.  (2020)  in  Spain, 
Lainsamputty  et  al.  (2018)  in  Indonesia,  and  Zeighami 
et al. (2013) and Momayyezi et al. (2015) in Iran all found 
that sleep quality was poor among heart failure patients 
[4,  33–37].  According  to  LEE  et  al.  (2016),  the  major-
ity  of  heart  failure  patients  had  sleep  problems  three  or 
more  times  per  week  in  the  past  month,  and  less  than 
one-third took sleeping medications in the last week [38]. 
Abedi  et  al.  (2012)  discovered  that  half  of  the  patients 
with  cardiovascular  disease  had  a  good  sleep  and  rest 
pattern, which contradicted the results of this study [39]. 
Edmealem  et  al.  (2020)  revealed  that  poor  sleep  quality 
was not common in Ethiopian patients with heart failure. 
The majority of patients slept for more than seven hours, 
had high habitual sleep efficiency, and did not use sleep-
ing medications [40]. These differences can be attributed 
to  differences  in  the  support  provided  by  heart  failure 
associations,  the  amount  of  training  provided  during 
discharge,  home  care,  and  differences  in  lifestyle,  socio-
demographic and cultural status [38–40].

According  to  the  results,  majority  of  the  participants 
had  sub-optimal  physical  activity.  Most  studies  indicate 
that a significant number of heart failure patients do not 
engage  in  physical  activities  [13,  41].  Fakharzadeh  et  al. 
(2015)  conducted  a  systematic  study  in  Iran  and  found 
that the majority of heart failure patients did not engage 
in enough physical activity [20].

The  current  study  results  revealed  a  moderate  sig-
nificant  relationship  between  sleep  quality  and  physical 
activity  among  patients  with  heart  failure,  implying  that 
patients who did more physical activity had better sleep 
quality. Furthermore, as physical activity increased, sleep 
quality improved in all subscales of subjective sleep qual-
ity, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, the use of 
sleeping  medications,  and  daytime  dysfunction.  On  the 
other hand, when patients get enough sleep, they do not 
feel  drowsy  during  the  day,  so  they  can  be  more  active 
and  focus  on  their  work  more.  It  is  particularly  impor-
tant  to  patients  who  do  more  regular  physical  activity,

because good sleep can involve in the healing and repair 
of their heart and blood vessels and boosts immune sys-
tem/function  [42].  Studies  in  this  field  have  also  shown 
that  patients  who  have  had  more  physical  activity  have 
had better sleep efficiency and duration, regardless of the 
type and intensity of activity [43, 44]. In this regard, Ash 
et  al.  (2020)  found  that  everyday  physical  activity  was 

associated  with  either  longer  sleep  at  the  same  night  or 
more physical activity on the next day [45]. DuBose and 
Hadi (2016) showed the long-term impacts of disturbed 
sleep  include  lower  physical  functioning  and  increased 
delirium [46].

Paparrigopoulos et al. (2010) discovered that heart fail-
ure patients who engaged in moderate to vigorous physi-
cal activity were less likely to suffer from sleep disorders 
compared with cardiac patients with light physical activ-
ity  [2].  This  study  clarifies  the  importance  of  physical 
activity  among  patients  with  heart  failure  and  can  help 
health care providers improve sleep quality and quality of 
life by training patients about physical activity.

The  results  of  the  study  showed  that  the  variables 
of  physical  activity,  sex,  history  of  heart  surgery,  and 
the  stage  of  illness  predicted  sleep  quality  in  patients 
with  heart  failure.  Beta  coefficients  demonstrated  that 
patients’  sleep  quality  improved  in  women  and  as  a 
result  of  an  increase  in  physical  activity.  Patients’  sleep 
quality  decreased  due  to  a  history  of  heart  surgery  and 
a  high  stage  of  disease.  Redeker  et  al.  (2005)  discovered 
a  strong  relationship  between  sleep  quality  and  heart 
failure  among  patients  with  chronic  heart  failure  [47]. 
Alt et al. (2013) demonstrated that women with chronic

rhino  sinusitis  and  those  with  other  diseases  had  poor 
sleep  quality,  which  was  not  strongly  associated  with 
the  disease  severity  [48].  They  believe  that  the  relation-
ship  between  disease  severity  and  poor  sleep  is  mutual, 
and  disability  predicts  worse  sleep,  which  in  turn  may 
predict  quality  of  life.  It  is  very  important  to  pay  atten-
tion to physical activity and quality of sleep in heart fail-
ure  patients  with  different  demographic  characteristics 
because clinically changes to sleep and physical inactivity 
in  cardiovascular  inpatients  produce  delirium,  immuno-
suppression and depression that may lead to readmission 
and  decrease  quality  of  life  [49].  Therefore,  it  is  recom-
mended  that  health  care  providers  pay  attention  to  this 
important issue in care planning and lifestyle training.

This  study  had  several  limitations.  Owing  to  the  fact 
that  temporal  and  seasonal  factors  affect  the  qual-
ity  of  sleep,  this  cross-sectional  study  cannot  assess  the 
patients’ quality of sleep over time and provide objective 
information about sleep, and it only reflects patients’ per-
ceptions of sleep and its quality. The impact of different 
cut-off  on  physical  activity  and  sleep  may  have  different 
results,  which  is  why  further  studies  are  recommended. 
On the other hand, due to the low value of the correlation 
coefficient  in  the  relationship  between  the  study  vari-
ables,  the  existence  of  a  confounding  variable  may  have 
caused a false or fake correlation, and finally, reverse cau-
sality bias may exist.

Conclusion
The  results  showed  that  the  sleep  quality  of  the  major-
ity  of  patients  with  heart  failure  in  this  study  was  poor 
and  their  physical  activity  was  not  at  a  desired  level.  In 
addition,  patients  who  were  more  physically  active  also 
had better sleep quality. Therefore, it is recommended to 
take the necessary measures to improve sleep quality by 
controlling or eliminating the factors that cause sleep dis-
orders, and also to identify the factors affecting patients’ 
compliance  with  physical  activity.  It  seems  that  improv-
ing  the  methods  of  increasing  physical  activity  can  be  a 
cost-effective care approach in improving the sleep qual-
ity of patients with heart failure.
